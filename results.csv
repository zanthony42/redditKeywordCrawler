One of the things I have thought about a lot regarding Sea of Thieves is how important audio cues are, how much harder it would be to play without being able to make use of them and how difficult it would be to add visual cues alongside the audio cues without having the visual cues seem out of place or be _too_ good. 

The rats are a stroke of genius. They're a visual cue to match the ship groaning audio cue. They fit thematically. It makes sense. It works. I'm very impressed, Rare.

What do you think? Can you think of any good ways to add visual cues for other things?

Unless they did something like the whole ship momentarily leaning on to that side (as if the pirate grabbing the ladder weighed a ton during that second lol), I can't think of any visual diegetic cue.

Distant explosions, gunshots or cannon shots could also appear as faint flashes out of the corner of the eye, in the screen rim.

Good luck in the search!","Hi I work at Rogers and know the building like the back of my hand so I may be able to help!

First off your best bet is the lower bowl over the upper bowl if you’re trying to avoid steps and want regular seats. The upper bowl has very steep stairs and may be challenging for someone with a bad knee. In the lower bowls the stairs are much longer and aren’t nearly as bad. For the least amount of walking try the drink rail right at the top (which is the same on both the upper and lower bowl so it’s the best option overall). Drink rail upper bowl tickets can be found for a fairly reasonable price. The seats themselves aren’t as good but you do get a ledge/table to put your drinks on which is a huge plus.

The ideal spot would be on the loge level as they have tables without having to do any stairs, however these are very pricey.

As for cutting down walking time, if you’re entering the building from Ford Hall try and pick tickets in sections 104-129/206-234. If you’re entering from the LRT entrance pick tickets in sections 113-118/221-226. These are the closest sections to the entrances and their respective escalators. There are also guest elevators in all four corners of the building that you can take instead of escalators. 

I’d recommend downloading the Rogers Place app as it’ll show you a map of all the closest bathrooms and concessions to your seats. There’s also a text assist number (587-207-4357) that you can message should you need wheelchair assistance.

They'll provide a free wheelchair for him to get to his seat if you ask. 

I think the ""accessible seats"" mentioned are more ones that have space to park a wheelchair, but I guess that also means one can get there without stairs - so maybe getting those would be better for him, even if he's just walking?","[https://aviewfrommyseat.com/venue/Rogers+Place/seating-chart/hockey/](https://aviewfrommyseat.com/venue/Rogers+Place/seating-chart/hockey/)

Understanding that the Cursed Possessions items themselves are meant to help out players with accessibility issues (i.e. not being able to trigger interactions and ghost events with voice chat) but fearing that these items are driving the game away from what it is supposed to be about.,4,r6vq6g,PhasmophobiaGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhasmophobiaGame/comments/r6vq6g/understanding_that_the_cursed_possessions_items/,14,"First of all, I love the amount of work the devs are putting into this game and I'm happy it's gotten as big as it has and I'm still excited to see what the future holds for Phasmo. This thread is just to address some reservations I have about the teasers we've seen for the upcoming Cursed Possessions update. 

I notice that these items are implemented in response to a lot of folks' issues with the game's RNG. 
The music box and the tortured voodoo doll can be used to trigger interactions without having to use the in-game voice chat, which would help to automate some interactions and finding some elusive or stubborn pieces of evidence, or even just finding the ghost itself. 
And obviously, the summoning circle spawns the ghost directly in one spot which will guarantee a chance for a ghost photo and such.

That might sound great in words, but my fear is that this is going to fall apart in execution.

Part of what has always made Phasmo great and scary (to me at least) is randomness. Unpredictability. My criticism is that I think the tortured voodoo doll and the music box are directly interfering with the atmosphere in the game. I understand it can be frustrating to have a quiet ghost or one that doesn't do much, but I really feel that interactions and such SHOULDN'T be automated like that. The player will now have the ability to trigger these things whenever they have these items, and now the player won't really be scared by these things happening since they're absolutely expecting them upon pressing a button. 
Unfortunately I feel this is the exact same issue but worse with the summoning circle. I WANT the ghost to randomly pop up and scare the crap out of me. I DON'T want the ability to spawn it at my will just because I need a photo of it. Not only does this take away the believability of the investigative aspect of the game, but once again it is automating something that used to be panic-inducing and such an exciting part of the game. 

And again, I want to make it known that I'm well aware of how frustrating the RNG can be in this game, how finicky ghost events are and how it can feel like the game is screwing you out of a photo and a completed objective. My point is that I feel there must be a better way to do this that doesn't involve automating something that's ciritical to the atmosphere of this game and the depth of it's replayability. 

My final thought is... I really don't like that these objects are bringing some overly experimental elements to the game. I'm not sure how I feel about magic things and sorcery being in the game now.
For those of us who grew up with Ghost Hunters and Ghost Adventures and other shows like them, this game is awesome because it really simulates what it is meant to: paranormal investigation. Not exorcisms, not magic and sorcery, not players controlling ghosts and trying to murder other players. Paranormal. Investigation. I have always felt that the core of the gameplay should always remain to be to identify the ghost type, gather evidence of its presence, and leave with some thrills and pumping adrenaline as you experience something otherworldly like that. I was always happy when DK would publicly state that demonic possessions and exorcisms and things like that won't be coming to the game, because that would be overkill and would ruin that core simulation of a legitimate paranormal investigation. 

To conclude, I wanna say I still trust these devs to make a great game. I trust that DK and CJ know what they're doing and won't let us down. The Cursed Possessions are coming whether I want them or not, and I'm gonna accept that and keep playing. 
My hope is that they've found a way to implement these things without distracting the game from what it was supposed to be and what has made it fun. I hope that the things that have always made this scary and exciting to me won't be invalidated by game mechanics that can now be automated by the player.

Certainly hope that's how it ends up.",1638410297.0,"You dont have to use them, you can play any way you want","I understand your points, but it only really takes away from the randomness you like if you use them. They’re not going to be required items (I’m sure) so you don’t HAVE to have them. No harm done. 

I think it’s a great addition for people that need them either because they are too scared of the randomness, but like to play, or need them for an accessibility reason.","Im assuming the doll will only spawn at the normal voodoo doll locations which are very hidden areas. Maybe you need to build the summoning circle. They increase the amount of candles you can bring on a hunt to the amount you need for the summoning circle so you need to add stuff to be able to use it, and maybe the music box or whatever its called will have a song hidden in a random spot on the map and you have to pick it up and put it into the music box","disagree entirely. i've been playing phasmo since the beginning and the thing missing from the game now *that it had before* is a greater sense of player agency in the investigation phase. we used to have more control over our environments, more control over the ghost, and could make more decisions about how we wanted to play. now it's being reintroduced in a format that has some checks and balances. 

personally, i think this could be a return to form. i enjoyed the game the most when i could find the ghost room with relatively little hemming and hawing; as those tools were nerfed or removed (thermo blitz was gone first, then audible footsteps were taken away, then doors always starting closed went on the chopping block), nothing replaced them, leaving me with no option but to spend more time just trying to *find* the ghost -- usually without any tools at all, which seemed against the spirit of a tool-based ghost investigation game -- and being at the mercy of RNG. increasing time spent inside waiting for the ghost to do shit doesn't increase the difficulty or the scariness, and it doesn't make the investigation more engaging, it just increases tedium and turns the game into a hide and seek simulator where in phase 1 i'm ""it"" and in phase 2 the ghost is ""it.""

i came to phasmophobia for:

1. unique ghost behavior & being rewarded for my perception

2. kicking down the door, bullying the ghost, shaking it until all the evidence falls out of its pockets, and leaving before it gets the sense to murder me for my audacity.

both of those things have been missing from the game for a big chunk of 2021 & i'm stoked to see that both of them might return in some new form in the next patch. ultimately, player agency is about the player having the ability to make decisions for themselves rather than having it decided for them -- and, like has already been said, you can always decide not to use the new items, but without those new items, i *can't* decide to not be subjected entirely to RNG.",Maybe wait for the update to come out before passing judgement.,Solution: Don't use the items,"Agreed that part of the fun and charm of the game is it’s randomness, as well as it’s (for lack of a better word) “realistic” feeling. I’m looking forward to seeing how the cursed items work, but I also hope that there will be a steep price for using them. Or perhaps it’ll be a toggle-on sort of thing that you can pick when you’re setting up the lobby? 

The devs are trying to come up with new content, and I love that, but there’s definitely a risk of losing the current feel of the game. Hope they go into doing more maps after this, tbh, lol.","Agree man, first I thought the possessed item is stuff that'll mess you up",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a medical condition that causes my joints to dislocate easily, my fingers are especially bad for it, and full auto would drastically reduce my risk of injury and allow me to play much longer than I normally would.","Seriously, don't do this to yourselves people. Physical pain and numbness in wrists/fingers is a genuine *warning signal*. Heed it; take a break for the day or switch activities. Everytime you keep pressing on, you roll the dice with developing *permanent* tendonitis/RSI. Burning, pinching pain in the wrists, even when just typing some words. A break is now too late. Months of rest can pass, the condition will remain.

Don't be cocky, being young or fit won't stop it all from developing. *Athletic hulks* doing overly repetitive lifting and running exercises encounter this condition. The human body was not designed for hours and hours of repetitive strains on the *same* muscles and tendons.

But, we know nobody listens to the ""take regular breaks"" advice, so consider this: You play until your wrists and fingers start *inflaming.* You're hardcore as it gets, there's nothing to prove for the next million repetitive clicks. Be hardcore in a smart way now. Respect your tendons health and let a single macro protect them from needless overload. Any big name keyboard/mouse brand (Logitech, Razer, Glorious, etc) offers easy-to-setup macros in their software. Looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/ZEqcxW3.png). Record the action, set it on loop, assign it to a side-button or something, boom done.

Rules vary but nearly all online games, including Warframe, are *a-okay* with players needing assistance from *simple* macros. MMOs like FF14 even encourage it. The only thing they don't want to see are *advanced* macros used for AFK-farming or for clutch-PvP like CS:GO.","Back for blood did this and I think its a great feature for any game with guns to have. Not only does it improve accessibility it also made me more likely to use weapons I would normally avoid, no matter how powerful they are semi-auto weapons are going to be annoying to use in a shooter after an extended duration.",I think this can be done with macros if you have peripherals that allow it. I’ve done it since I use Razer stuff and made a macro for melee slide attacks. Can’t be much different for semi-auto to full auto. Might get complicated trying to manage recoil and synchronize to the fire rate.,"Please, I often avoid weapons that require me to click fast. I just can't do it for long periods of time.","Yep. Destiny 2, Overwatch, etc. Plenty of games do this, it doesn't lower ""skill"". Just reduces repetitive strain.",Bandaid solution: Set the alternate bind for Fire Weapon to mouse wheel up or down and get a mouse with a free-spin toggle.,"Something i would like to see, that DE has been doing more often, is making alt fires being toggled...

Like on ps4/5 holding R3 to fire the pentas saw and hold it out is very unenjoyable and uncomfortable... let me swap from auto to held (the old days it was the aim button that shot the alt fire)

My aim is mostly the same but I would like this option so I can go back to being normal haha,"Also, DE, some weapons have fast charged shots, meaning scroll-wheel doesn't fix this.",I mean how bout DE let Fire rate do it’s job and let use just hold down the trigger to fire?,"Can we have it for melee as well? Hold down E or mouse click for repeated inputs, instead of continuous.","Honestly even without having these problems full auto would be nice. Input queueing is jjst weird, so to get max fire rate you gotta literally shoot to the rythm which is basically impossible to do constantly","Agree, personally I only use weapons that auto full auto or charging times and highly effective oneshots (like kuva karak or probocyst cernos) for same reasons as melee i use only glaive as spamming E gets hard on my fingers after 30 min of game play...","Fully agree.

Need Advice on Subtitle Accessibility while watching Digital Content.,2,r6j1b4,astigmatism,https://www.reddit.com/r/astigmatism/comments/r6j1b4/need_advice_on_subtitle_accessibility_while/,0,"Hi there!

I have had severe astigmatism since a very young age (I think it was -4ish since age 3 when I was first tested) and am at -5.5 in both eyes with 0 spherical power.

I am a geek, and work in IT too, so I basically look at screens all day (and all night too). My life is screens.

I do use dark mode everywhere even though it's a pain, but lesser pain than the strains caused by pure white brightness.

But I absolutely am unable to watch movies with subtitles. Like, at all. I do require subtitles as I watch primarily English movies but am not a native speaker.

I was wondering, what is the best color combination for subtitles while watching movies, and also, the contrast that provides the least amount of strain in the eyes (both dark mode friendly and astigmatism friendly). What is the sweet spot for us?

Lack of accessibility is what is going to kill this game. Not bugs,3,r5ymzr,newworldgame,https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/r5ymzr/lack_of_accessibility_is_what_is_going_to_kill/,2,"So, I'm on about a week long break from the game. Decided to wait until server merges. I felt like it was a good idea. However today I logged in just to check on things because I genuinely want to play/like the game. But the same things just killed my motivation to play.

Was it the bugs? Nah. People with duped items that never got banned? Nah fuck them and there voidbent, doesn't bother me none. 

It's the fact that on a medium to low pop server. Everything is a ghost town in endgame. If your a solo player, or only run In small groups,  your screwed. Just go pick flowers all day. Smack rocks. Chop trees. Oh the joys of farming.

Seriously. Anything endgame,  even before the health change to elites, was seriously hard to do as a solo or small group. 

Sure this is a mmo. Massive multiplayer is even in the genre. But I don't like the toxic manchildren I meet who's vocabulary seems to only consist of words seen in most twitch chats. I don't want to play with those types and it's all I've really seen.

Although, there is a diverse consumer base here. But, alot of people feel this way.  Alot of people have their core group they play with and don't really dip into other groups when they are alone.

Not to mention the thousands of solo players who only join groups to clear content they have to do.

All in all. Im just saying. The mmo crowd that plays them, they hate bugs. But they will deal with it. They hate gameplay loops, but they will deal with it. They will continue to deal as long as they have a means to progress. This game has smacked small groups and solos in the face almost every patch.

I may be wrong. But I'm pretty sure there are more solos, and small group types of people then there are those that want to join huge companies and always wants to be in a maxed out party. You just don't hear from solo players much as we/they just keep to themselves.

Make the game accessible to all group sizes. Just an example of a way, as I don't like to point out a problem without a solution, is to make scaling work like borderlands, but tie it to the enemy's tether range. 

Example. Solo player attacks enemy. Because it's one person, enemies health stays at base value, loot drop stays at base value. Another solo player joins the battle. Enemies health increases by 20%, loot drop chance increase 2%. A duo joins, now 4 people fighting one enemy.enemies health has increased 60% (3 more joined total, 20% increase x3), loot now 6% higher drop chance.

This could also work to prevent zergs in the same way. Zerg would increase health dramatically. Maybe after +10 people are fighting the same enemy his damage goes through the roof.

I'm just brainstorming on the fly sort of. But a change like that would prevent zergs, and make content accessible to all, even if in some cases it may be almost impossible for a solo to fight a world boss, the above system would still give means of progression for everyone while making it accessible to all and challenging for groups.

TLDR: Imo, the games issue is accessibility. Especially after a large portion of the player base has quit/waiting. Telling people to just join a group isn't practical for everyone. Above is an example of how you could make it accessible and still have a challenge for all group sizes.",1638309661.0,"The bugs, duping, botting, exploiting, etc killed it for me.

We promptly apologize for any specific issue you're facing with **GNOME**.

Since our Subreddit isn't the ideal place for Bug reporting and your bug reporting might even not being seen by the Developers, we recommend creating a bug report on our Issue/Bug Tracker.

* For doing so, we recommend first to give a check on the existing Issues on our [Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.gnome.org/groups/GNOME/-/issues) by using the search functionality. If you believe there's already a similar issue created, we recommend giving a ""thumbs up"" to the existing issue, instead of commenting on it. If you have technical information like (logs, screenshots, or other data) that might help, then we recommend you to comment unto the existing issue.

* If you believe there's not an issue fitting your problem, you can create a new Issue by clicking the green button _(Select project to create an issue)_ and select in the dropdown list a project that you believe that fits the problem. For example, if you're facing a problem with the file explorer, the respective project would be Nautilus. If you're unsure where to create it, feel free to reach out our [Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/gnome) for help. You might also ask for help directly on this Subreddit.

**Note.:** Ensure you're attaching enough information, like, screenshots, steps to reproduce, your hardware information, Linux distribution you're using, what you were doing before, error logs or system logs if there are any, and also which version of GNOME you're using. Beware that we do not provide support anymore to legacy versions of GNOME. (Eg.: If the current version of GNOME is 3.38, a legacy version would be 3.34).

We hope your issues are solved. You might also help guidance from the Community. Most of the problems are easily solvable by just following some steps other users recommend.

The Audio balance feature (Accessibility > Audio balance) should have a setting for phone speaker vs headphone/Bluetooth etc.,2,r5f13a,GooglePixel,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r5f13a/the_audio_balance_feature_accessibility_audio/,1,"I only found out about the audio balance feature very recently.  My previous 4 XL has horribly imbalanced audio from the phone speakers where 90% of the volume was coming from the bottom speaker and only a tiny portion from the top/ear piece.  This gave a pretty poor experience to watching videos in landscape since the audio was so horribly unbalanced.

I noticed my 6 pro also had imbalance.  Not as bad as my 4 XL, but still enough to be noticeable.

So I went and adjusted the audio balance option and the phone speakers sounded great.

Except I found that my Bluetooth audio was now very imbalanced.

So I changed it back and just kind of put up with the phone speakers being imbalanced.

Which sucks.  It would be great if there was an output-specific setting.

But really I would love for Google to put more effort into audio-related things.  I'm not even an audiophile.  It could be fixed in either way; more attention to native audio balance of the phone speakers, or building or features/settings to address the actual use-cases where people use more than one audio output, so having a global setting isn't a good approach.

Disagree. 

Accessibility adds a whole new layer of work. You gain additional requirements that need to be approved, satisfied and tested.

For each of these steps you need people with the necessary knowledge. You need one to write the requirement, one to implement it and one to verify the result.

You may also need additional content that needs to be produced (e.g. text in a simplified language,  captions/subtitles, sign language, ...).

And on an organizational level, you need a responsible department that organizes regular audits, trainings, answers questions, does the reporting, and so on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm having a hard time with Haskell. What other functional programming languages is a few steps below it regarding accessibility (for a OO programmer)? I'm thinking about Elm...,31,r4w3oe,functionalprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming/comments/r4w3oe/im_having_a_hard_time_with_haskell_what_other/,61,"At first, what caught my attention on Haskell was it is strongly imposed immutability and from there I learned about pure function. I eventually got really excited with its simple syntax and expressivity. However, after more than a month studying about it full time (I'm not working at the moment) it seems the possibility to create something minimally meaningful while knowning what I am doing seems really far away. I'm still struggling a lot with state and IO and basic concepts.

Maybe I'm just not really smart and I am okay with that.

My point is, I'm really excited with functional programming and would like to learn more, so I would like to take a look at other languages and would welcome suggestions.

~~I'm strongly inclined to Elm. According to wikipedia, its purely functional, all data are immutable and its syntax seems to be pretty much Haskell. I've seem some complaints about newer versions frequently breaking compatibility, but if this is the worst it could get I think I could get around that.~~[Nevermind.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22821447)

Few features that I would really like to see in it:

- strongly typed

- immutability on all data structures is encouraged or at least possible

- tail call optimization would be really great

- preferably not multi-paradigm

- decent community, library and documentation



 Other language considerations:

I worked with JS for many years, but it is not strongly typed, its main functions has mutability everywhere, and its multi-paradigm. It seems that ""JS is technically functional"" is kinda a meme at this point, but I might be unfair for not knowing better about it.

I tried Clojure and actually liked it, although its polish notation still feels counter intuitive to me and the possibility to use other mutable Java libraries would make it every easy for me to do something bad (which includes Scala, Kotlin and Groovy).

I've seen some excitement with Elm, Erlang and Elixir, but didn't dig much deeper on these yet. Although multi-paradigm, saw same things with Rust.

People seem to like Ruby, but I don't much know about it.

Python does not have forced immutability.

Didn't seem much of F#, but seems to have a decent community.",1638193326.0,"I would recommend OCaml, which is a functional programming language more on the ""pragmatic"" side than Haskell. (F# is a .NET variant of OCaml, the two languages are relatively close to each other.) OCaml is easier to learn, overall simpler; and it has the strong quality that it is easy to predict and reason about the performance of idiomatic code (something which is very hard with Haskell).

On the negative side:

- OCaml does not track side-effects at the type-level by default; this is great for simplicity (no need for monads to write normal programs, only in some more elaborate libraries for concurrency etc.), but less elegant conceptually: you have to explicitly declare it if you want a datatype field to be mutable, but then you will be able to mutate it (explicitly) in any function, without changing the function type. (On the other hand, the ergonomics of type-level effect tracking are okay to bad in practice, even in Haskell, this is not something that language designers know to do very well yet.)
- OCaml lacks some excellent features of Haskell, in particular type classes.
- Like Haskell, OCaml has a somewhat small library ecosystem. F#, Scala and Clojure may have an easier time due to the ease of calling into the .NET or Java ecosystem. The tooling is also not to Go's or Rust's standard -- but I would say that it is reasonable nonetheless.

(OCaml supports object-oriented programming if one wants to use it, but it is a rarely-used feature of the language. It is not ""multi-paradigm"" in the same sense that Scala that tries to blend the two styles.)

Elm has an interesting focus on user experience and some nice features, but it is not a general-purpose language, it is restricted to web development. I think that it's a good choice if you know that the web is your only focus, but maybe not otherwise.","Sometimes it can feel like you're not progressing even though you are, that being said my few thoughts (as someone experienced with Ruby, Elm, Scala, and a little Haskell) are:

- if you're still interested in functional programming keep going, it'll click eventually
- elm seems like a great option if you're somewhat familiar the JavaScript ecosystem, you'll def be able to see tangible results (in your browser) which may help you
- maybe try Elixir so you dont have to deal with all the type stuff on top of functional programming, as someone who switched from Ruby to Scala I very much appreciate strongly typed and complex type stuff now, but it was a challenge to learn
- Ruby can be written functional-ish but it's core is OO, so I'd stay away unless you have other goals or just like it","Erlang is a pragmatic language that works really well in its intended domain: fault tolerant distributed systems. That's my go to for building systems like that, where I never ever want to receive a phone call at 4 am. I have an Erlang system that's been running for 2 decades, no phone calls yet.

Ocaml is a pragmatic language a little closer to the ""pure"" FP side. It's a great language for getting stuff done, and plays well with others. It generates blazingly fast code, but can also run as interpreted code, which allows for nicer debugging.",Scala 3 is very nice. It fixes most if not all of scala 2 issues. I would look into a library eco system called ZIO for functional effects also.,"[Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org/) helped me to get into the right mindset. It's a simple, functional language with similar syntax to Haskell. When I decided to go into Haskell more seriously, I first completed a small, fun Futhark project.","So here's my 2c FWIW. 

Edit: please take the opinions below in terms of the context - I was also evaluating my first possible FP language for beginner friendliness as well as overall value for time invested. 

TL;DR I strongly recommend trying F#, even though I'm still learning it. As I'm still learning it, take my opinion with a pinch of salt. For context, I'm a Ruby dev mostly with a fair bit of TS/JS, C# and some Go experience and I wanted to get into FP for similar reasons (typing, mutability issues, among others). So, I did the thing any rational lazy programmer would do and became an armchair expert in a few different languages (i.e. I watched YouTube and read blogs for a few weeks with a bit of tinkering on the side).

I passed on these languages:

* Elm - too purist. Elegant and safe, especially the MVU model but it feels very dogmatic. The language creator seems to hold a tight leash on the language and won't let anyone else contribute JS interop modules (AFAIR). Big drama if you Google enough. Frontend only too.
* ReScript/ReasonML/BuckleScript - OCaml for the frontend that self-destructed. Got really excited about this after Elm till I realised there was a political falling out that split the community (and repo) in two and left a flaming mess behind. There are actually videos and articles trying to explain what language is what and how it's not the other one. Not going near that till it sorts itself out.
* Elixir - not statically typed. As a Ruby dev Elixir seemed amazing. The Erlang VM also seemed nice and sparkly. People that work with it seemed to love it. But I just don't want to do dynamically typed code anymore. I don't want unit tests or error notifiers to tell me I made a type error. I want the compiler to do that. I want my IDE to quickly tell me the type of something without doing lookups or using fuzzy tooling (which Elixir kind of has I think).
* OCaml - shaky ecosystem, poor tooling and libraries. So OCaml I actually started learning because it just clicked in terms of FP + pragmatism. But the tooling is a bit of a patchwork, the libraries and docs are okish only and AFAIR it still has a global interpreter lock like Ruby, something I won't put up with again without an excellent reason. Like all the languages here, some people love it and have been very successful with it but I wanted something a bit more beginner friendly (i.e. solid) ecosystem wise.
* Haskell and Rust - the nunchucks of their respective areas, very powerful, very impressive, but learning's going to hurt. I looked at them, admired them and then moved on.

The reasons I passed on those languages are largely the reasons I chose F#:

F# is about getting things done and getting them done right with a functional-first but pragmatic approach. The themes of F# according to its creator are for it to be ""succinct, robust, performant"" which I think is true but being modest. It's what happens when a language is designed with a laser focus on pragmatism and even a disdain for anything that isn't useful or practical. I believe it will tick all your boxes.

More than that, you seems to get your cake and eat it too:

* You want Elm's beauty, MVU pattern and safety without tossing out the whole NPM ecosystem? Enter [Elmish](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/component-elmish/)\+ [Fable](https://fable.io/)\- you write F# (***full*** F# with almost ***all*** the .Net base classes) and its translated to JS. Write MVU frontends (like Elm) using React to render a VDom. Also use whatever other JS libraries you want in type-safe F#. Just beautiful. Plus, you can very easily share code between the backend and frontend. All your domain models, validations, service code for calling other APIs - no duplication, no synching up in two different languages. I could go on for ages, it's really impressive.
* You want OCaml's amazing type system with little to no annotations but full static typing? You got it. You don't get type classes because, well, pragmatism but you get a bunch of other cool stuff.
* You want a huge ecosystem of solid libraries and a solid runtime? .Net is very mature and battle tested. Most things accessible to C# are accessible to F# too and .Net Core has made it open source and cross-platform (I code on Linux with no issues). Seriously, I know there's still a Micro$oft stigma and in previous it was deserved but I don't think it is anymore. .Net Core is fantastic.
* You want Rust/Haskell's performance? Well, write Rust or Haskell. But F# on .Net is quite impressive performance wise and for a lot of scenarios close enough.
* The community is great and the documentation is quite good for an FP language. Learning resources are also very good.

As for not being multi-paradigm, F# is but I don't think that should be considered a drawback. If you go look at [the language benchmarks game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/) and look at the actual code samples you'll see that a lot of the fastest FP languages' code samples are written, well, not very functionally. There's mutation and loops and imperative stuff everywhere. Because imperative coding is generally still faster and more efficient than FP coding. I'd advise you to embrace functional coding as another tool, not a religion. Sometimes object-based code is appropriate and F# allows that, because F# is about getting things done, not breeding disciples of a purist pursuit. F# is multi-paradigm the same way JS/TS is functional. You can do it if you really want but you're going against the grain and it will guide you towards functional-first coding. 

Here are the resources I recommend to get started:

* [F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) \-  a great website with a collection of things
* The author of that site wrote a book about DDD and F# combined which I found great as it gradually introduces F# syntax as well as its features in the context of a business application.
* The blogs at [Compositional IT](https://www.compositional-it.com/news-blog/), an F# agency
* The found of Compositional IT also [wrote a book](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Programming-guide-NET-developers/dp/1617293997) that Don Syme, the creator of F#, has recommended in multiple talks.
* [The Elmish book](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/) is a great tutorial on Elmish in F# that walks you through building Elm-like apps in F# for the frontend.
* [The SAFE dojo](https://github.com/CompositionalIT/SAFE-Dojo) is a tutorial repo for getting started with fullstack F# apps using the F# ""framework"" (although it's more of an unopinionated template/collection of libraries for writing fullstack apps). I'd suggest starting with Fable/Elmish before diving into a full SAFE stack app though.

P.S. Ruby is as functional as JS. Probably less so in fact. It's also smothered by the behemoth that Rails became - it's hard to find good Ruby code because most of it is Rails code or Rails-compatible code and if you're interested in FP you won't like it. It will always have a special place in my heart because of what it enabled me to do but I wouldn't recommend it in your case.","I found this book really useful: https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide/
It’s aimed at javascript developers without any preliminary knowledge of FP and does a really good job at going through FP concepts step by step","I can say something about the language differences between Haskell and Elm, which is mainly that Elm doesn't have higher kinded types. So although you can write some `function :: List a -> List a` which can take Lists with any `a` inside it, be it `Int`, `String` or whatever, you could not write a `function :: f a -> f a`, where you are additionally abstracting over the type of container. So you end up with `List.map`, `Tree.map`, `Hashmap.map`, and so on, which makes the language a little noisier, and less ""ridiculous"" for some people (Functor, Applicative, Monad and so on is not a thing). Elm also forces you to use the ""elm architecture"", which is essentially a design pattern. That makes sense in my opinion, because it's only for web development anyways, and it gives you guard rails, but it's a paradigm.

Elm also has eager evaluation instead of Haskells more exotic lazy evaluation strategy. 

Regarding tail call elimination, I don't see how it could work without, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to traverse large data structures without overflowing the stack (maybe there is compiler magic for certain types though, anyway I don't think it's an issue)

I remember it being very similar to haskell.","Don’t give up. We’ve all been there. 
Haskell IS hard to begin with. 

If you want to learn Haskell. Do it, it will be very rewarding In the end - also for programming in other languages.","I’d also recommend ReScript and F# as a frontend / backend pair. If you’re familiar with JavaScript, then starting with ReScript is a good bet - the semantics of the two are quite similar (they’re both OCaml derivatives), but the syntax of ReScript is likely to be more familiar.","Scala hits a sweet spot between going full java/oop with lot nicer syntax and good FP support to also be able to reach into proper full blown FP without caring much about oop. It has been usually a journey I've seen many people take over the years with starting into a most oop language and going up to more functional style step by step by learning and applying what they can and fits in their needs.

I've been personally trying to learn ocaml and sml but they syntax is hard many times because the language family is different. Scala keeps the familiar syntax one is more used in mainstream languages.","You can't go wrong with LISP.

Common LISP has Objects and classes which will feel familiar","I’d recommend Elm. I’ve studied other functional languages (and use some professionally now). Elm was the gateway to practical use for me. With all the others - Haskell, LISP, and Erlang specifically - it was a challenge to see how to build practical software with it. I knew it could be done, but I’d be half way through a book and it still wasn’t evident. It’s tough to stay motivated in that situation. Elm is different in that it is for creating web applications. The “hello world” of Elm is close enough to something useful that it’s easy to see how you would apply it. The syntax of the language is also pretty compact, so it doesn’t take that long to learn (in fairness, most FP languages have a compact syntax). And, despite Elm being a front-end language, it isn’t a toy language at all. It’s a powerful language and what you learn will be directly applicable to other FP languages.","I would recommend you try out Clojure.

For me in the beginning trying to learn Haskell I struggled with almost not understanding how to get anything done.

Clojure also has a bit of a steep learning curve, but allowing to be impure in some places, giving me a very interactive playground, and removing the static types which do add a whole other layer of difficulty, that did it for me. Its what allowed me to really begin to understand FP. I was then able to try Haskell again and things made sense now, and all that was left is learning the typed layer on top.

This also is a logical progression, since Lambda Calculus came first, and then Typed Lambda Calculus was added to it. So starting with just the Lambda Calculus is a good transition into the types variant of it.

Clojure will still force you into immutability, recursion, lazyness, function composition, higher order functions, using functions and closures as your primary units, etc. So it won't let you cheat out of those like I've found it possible to do in Scala.

That's my 2 cents.","If youeve worked in JS ans used Redux at all, some of those concepts will trickle down nicely to functional programming.","Op, try Roc it's fully functional general purpose language direct descended of Elm.","Use Haskell to solve https://projecteuler.net problems.

You are not going to make anything amazing while learning FP. 

Just start small, skip any problems that stump you. After you solve them in Haskell do them in another language.","If you have a lot of JS experience, ReScript might be a good choice. Its syntax looks familiar to JS and it compiles to JS, but it has basically the same type system as OCaml and supports a lot of nice functional things like partial application, pattern matching, piping, and immutable data types.","I've enjoyed clojure personally, but I can guarantee it has nothing to do with you not being smart enough. Anyone can learn anything, we are all just different and need the lessons provided in certain ways","Scala may be a choice if you are from JVM world,","F# is the BEST functional programming language without any doubt, or question!

Might be a bit of an overstatement, but F# is cool. Very pragmatic. good, albeit small community. Also, Compiles to JS, and soon to Python. very succinct, and promotes writing clear, safe, code. Also, the .Net framework is fast, versatile, and has a large community.

I suggest starting from Don Syme's book ""Expert F#""",Try elm,"One more thought. Elm checks all of your boxes. It’s single-paradigm, immutable, and strongly typed. It’s a very pure functional language. It’s almost mathematical. Another cool feature is that “null” doesn’t exist in it. I think that’s a big benefit.

Elm does share a lot of syntax with Haskell. In fact, the creator of Elm is a Haskell developer and the Elm compiler is written in Haskell. Syntactically though, I think Elm might more closely resemble F#.

One note on the Elm compiler is that the error messages are top-notch. They don’t just tell you something is wrong, but they tell you why it is wrong and hire to fix it. It’s very useful when you are learning.","It sounds like the enforced purity and immutability are both appealing to you, and I agree that those two things are important for true functional programming. There are not many languages that exist today, IMO, that are strict in a particular paradigm. They're all trying to be ""Jacks of all trades"" and ""take the best of every paradigm, blah blah blah.""

I've never used Elm, and I frankly hate the entire JavaScript ecosystem, so I'm not sure how strict or awesome it is. There's also a project called PureScript that I don't know much about, but you might want to check out.

Elixir is kind of weird. It's definitely all about immutability, but I'm not sure I'd call it ""functional"" per se. It and Erlang are kind of their own thing. Elixir is a fantastically productive language, though.

Otherwise, Haskell is it. No other language is actually unashamedly functional.

There are several languages that are very conducive and optimized for functional programming, though. Clojure and Scala both come to mind, even though you mentioned the ability to use Java as a downside. But that's the best you're going to get, IMO. Just don't use Java. This isn't like an alcohol addiction- having Java nearby shouldn't be dangerous...

Rust is my favorite language, but definitely not functional (you acknowledged that it's ""multi-paradigm"", but I'd say that, like Elixir, idiomatic Rust is kind of its own thing. But it's definitely more imperative and OOP than FP).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IPhone accessibility features?,5,r56tvn,Blind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/r56tvn/iphone_accessibility_features/,8,"I am looking to switch from android to iPhone and wondering if anyone can explain to me if there is a speak on touch feature and how it works.


As I have some usable vision, I prefer not to use voice over solely and currently use select to speak on android. This feature works by having a small button in the bottom right of the screen which once pressed allows me to highlight any section of the screen to be read aloud. This includes the reading of icons, settings menus, buttons within apps, reddit and most other things.


On iPhone I've come across a gesture called spoken content which appears to have a finger icon which allows you to do something similar but this seems to require more button presses than the equivalent on android. For example I'd have to click on the spoken content icon then select the finger and then drag on what I want read aloud as opposed to just selecting the select to speak icon which sits in the corner once and then highlight what I want read on android.


Is what I've said above correct? Is there such a feature on iPhone or do you have any other possible solutions?


I am aware of the speak screen feature but not interested in this as I don't want the entire screen to be read every time I want a small specific section to be read.",1638223142.0,"There's something called ‘speak selection’. Once enabled in settings, you select text normally as if you were going to copy and paste it, then in the bar that pops up (which says 'copy', 'paste, 'select all', etc), they'll be a button that says 'speak'. Click that and it will read to you. If you can't read the text on the buttons to press that, how I do it is just by learning how many buttons along the 'speak' button is. 
There's also a feature — which I only just learnt about whilst having a look for you — called ‘speak on touch’ which looks a lot more like what you're describing. When enabled in settings, they'll be a small button that you can move around the edge of you screen. If you press and hold it for a few seconds, it will read the entire screen. If you double tap it and then drag your finger around, it will read what your finger is hovering over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accessibility for Pokémon games on switch,3,r585tu,pokemon,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/r585tu/accessibility_for_pokémon_games_on_switch/,5,"Hi all, I hope this post makes sense and doesn’t sound dumb af. Anyway my wife got me very much into Pokémon lol, watching the shows, movies, playing the mobile game. I have tried the games on the switch and on older gameboys in the past but never got into them for one main reason. 

I have dyslexia and struggle with games that have a lot of text like this to read. (I’m an avid gamer) most other games I play have narration etc. I struggle with games like Pokémon on the switch because of the text/it’s font/ style. It takes me what feels like an excruciatingly long time to fully read each section of text and eventually I just get frustrated and stop because it’s more annoying than enjoying which sucks. 

I was wondering if there was any way for this to be text to speech or something? 
I hope it doesn’t sound dumb, I’d just love to be able to enjoy the games because otherwise I either skip rapid through the text  (totally missing the story) or spend so much trying to read it I just give up lol 
(Its hard to explain, I can obviously read but the font and style can make it very difficult it’s like puzzle pieces moving around in my brain which leads to frustration) 

Anyway thanks in advance :)",1638226907.0,"I’d recommend just setting the text speed to fast, reading whatever you can pay attention to and just keep going. BDSP has a good story, but the games are made that you really don’t have to really read through everything to know what to do next or to get a grasp of what’s going on. 

If you wanna catch the story later, you could breeze through a let’s play of it on YouTube or play along side a let’s play so that they could read the text aloud for you to listen to while you play. 

Hope that helps. I feel ya.","Unfortunately text to speech isn’t an option. 

You could also try in settings and change text speed to Fast and just mash A skipping all the dialogue if you still wish to play.","You could always try and find somebody on YouTube who has done a playthrough and just watch their videos because I'm sure they will read along the dialogue. And then you could periodically return to that series as you progress up to those points in your own game. Basically what I'm saying is for you to speed through the game as much as you want and then just essentially listen to an ""audiobook"" version of what you skipped after the fact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Beginner's Guide to Endwalker Early Access,2446,r780wn,ffxiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/r780wn/a_beginners_guide_to_endwalker_early_access/,354,"1. ""Wake up at 1 AM PST"" hahahaha just kidding you weren't able to sleep because you were literally vibrating out of your bed with hype and you instead resorted to repeat-watching the Endwalker trailers

2. Scream with primal frustration at your PC/PS4 when it doesn't immediately unlock at exactly 1 AM.

3. Begin downloading, curse your awful internet for making turtles look like Sanic in comparison. I PAID FOR FIBER TWELVESDAMNIT

4. Get into queue

5. Realize the queue is a mountain long and go walk, make some breakfast, brew some coffee haha just kidding your hype cannot be contained, you'll instead literally stare the queue into submission

6. Get a 90006 error, then a 2002 error. Joke that you'll see this error 90,000 times today. Realize after the fifth time that this may not be a joke.

7. Get back into queue, actually consider getting breakfast this time, so you get into your car, and into the McDonalds drive thru

8. An eerily prescient drive thru attendant asks if you have a long day ahead of you because you look like you've already been through the ringer

9. Mumble ""The Final Days are upon us"" in a stupor. Make eye contact with the employee behind the drive thru guy nods knowingly. He knows. 

10. Resist your natural tempering to immediately explain that the award winning MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a free trial that includes the critically-acclaimed expansion Heavensward. The attendant flinches as if you had already started. The employee nods. He's already said it. Multiple times. The attendant reacts with fear in his eyes. Please, his eyes plead. Don't say it. Don't say the words.

11. Get back home, wonder what the fuck just happened. Eat dat McGriddle like your life depends on it.

12. Check queue. Still in queue. Fuck.

13. Watch the trailer again. Maybe the 90001th time you'll catch something new.

14. Get in!

15. Get kicked out immediately. The 90006/2002 Errors will haunt your every nightmare.

16. Get in! For realsies this time!

17. Realize you logged out in Limsa because you wanted Sage real bad, and now you are frozen in a sea of lag and crossdressing bunny bois

18. Wonder yet again why you took today off of work

19. Realize you did this two years ago too, and the results were even worse than last time

20. Start MSQ

21. Cry

22. Cry some more.

23. why won't the tears stop

24. Friends call, expressing concern

25. Ask if your friends have checked out the award winning mmorpg only to be cut off ""I can't DO this anymore, you need help""

26. I don't need help

27. I just need Endwalker

28. Just Endwalker

Seeking recommendations for blasters with electric firing for accessibility mods.,1,r5484r,nerfmods,https://www.reddit.com/r/nerfmods/comments/r5484r/seeking_recommendations_for_blasters_with/,2,"Been a long time since I could say I use Reddit for my day job, but here goes.

I work for the South Carolina Assistive Technology Program, which is part of the University of South Carolina School of Medicine.  (Go r/Gamecocks.)  One of the programs we put on each year is a workshop to modify toys so people who need external switch control can interact with them.  Usually, this is something like a stuffed toy that plays peek-a-boo or a robot that dances and plays music.

[Here's an example of a toy that's already been adapted.](https://enablingdevices.com/product/baby-pug/)  See the headphone jack looking thing coming out of the back?  It's, uh, a headphone jack; the assistive technology world standardized on that as its connector so people can plug in, say, a [sip and puff switch](https://enablingdevices.com/product/36-easy-flex-sip-puff-switch/) or [one they press with their head](https://enablingdevices.com/product/head-switch/) or [a big brightly-colored button](https://enablingdevices.com/product/plate-switches/).

Well, one therapist dropped me a line asking about a NERF blaster.  I've never done such a mod, but I'm not one to shy away from a challenge.  By the standards of the NERF modding community, this should be a pretty tame mod--no LiPo setups or changing the flywheel to put extra stank on it, just making it accept external switches.

I searched around and saw Out Of Darts posted a few photos from the inside of some blasters to market their mods.  For example, the [Hyper Mach-100](https://outofdarts.com/collections/full-mod-kits-2019/products/hyper-mach-100-rewire-kit-battery-not-included) appears to have two switches where we could whip out a soldering iron and make it compatible with our switches.  Conversely, [the Spectrum has a sprung linkage](https://outofdarts.com/collections/full-mod-kits-2019/products/adventure-force-spectrum-complete-mod-kit-no-battery?variant=39583748358186); I'm sure someone can engineer a way to motorize that, but it's beyond the scope of our workshop.

Is there a list of blasters out there that use the two-switch setup?  Am I barking up the right tree for such a build?  I know I'm coming in as an outsider, but hopefully I've covered all the bases in the questions.",1638216094.0,"Here's a good video that did exactly that with a Prometheus might be some good inspiration or just follow the guide https://youtu.be/61oJ3uOSB70

Also you're really going to want a full auto blaster preferably with a high capacity to limit reloads which would probably have to be preformed by an assistant. In that line a Prometheus, nemesis, Perses or even the kahos are going to be good options. If you want something that shoots darts the hyperfire and rapidstrike are both good options but the dart zone scorpion would probably be the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though never officially confirmed a suspect, suspicion has fallen in recent years on career criminal Gerard L'Gdaye.  He is currently living in Brazil (which has no extradition treaty with Belgium) and coincidentally moved there less than a week after the heist.  He might have been caught red-handed except for the fact that police, *twice*, did not investigate him.  

The first time was when his vehicle appeared in CCTV footage less than 2 blocks from the crime scene, but the police were too busy with other leads and skipped over this clue.  The 2nd time he was detained at the airport because of his resemblance to the chocolate-giving customer, but was skipped over for tighter scrutiny because of heavy holiday travel that day.

Which is where we got the saying ""never skip L'Gdaye"".",Sounds like a good vehicle for one of Hollywood's many elderly action stars.,"Lmfao, how could they possibly benefit from him accessing the bank vault?!",he probably shared the diamonds with the employess than he shared chocolates too.,"In all fairness, chocolates are pretty expensive.",Reminds me of the lawyer with the cake pops in Breaking Bad,"Sweet, old men can get away with anything.",He's a old man what's he going to do...?

That is the point of this.","What’s truly ludicrous is the foundation this suit is based on. 

>	Mississippi has made the case that women have progressed enough economically since the 1970s to make abortion unnecessary. Before Roe v. Wade, “there was little support for women who wanted a full family life and a successful career,” Mississippi’s attorney general, Lynn Fitch, said in a statement summarizing a brief filed to the court.

Yes it will impact marginalized people the most. However, if Roe is overturned or weakened it will enshrine that women are not equal under the LAW and the ""interest of the state"" is GREATER than the woman's interest. Pregnant women and children, regardless of how the pregnancy occurred, will be nothing more than property of the state who gets to decide what is best for the woman.

"Take the Vaccine or Don't take it, but there is absolutely nothing Libertarian about not respecting the rights of individual property owners to deny access to the unvaccinated.",383,r7cgj2,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/r7cgj2/take_the_vaccine_or_dont_take_it_but_there_is/,372,"Every time this issue is mentioned, it's framed as about getting the vaccine or not, and whether government has the right to mandate a vaccine.

And that's all well and good, there's a ton of great thought and debate to be had about the precise limits of government power and authority, and then contrasting the legal limits with what we think philosophically they ought to be.

But every anti-vaxxers I have spoken to insist on going into the properties of others.   The store, the bank, the gas station, the movies, Etc.

If someone has a conditional acceptance to you being on their property, and you don't meet that condition, you are trespassing.    Full stop.

Property rights are among the most basic rights we enjoy, and generally the one most touted by libertarians as needing to be strengthened and further protected.    So why do so many ""Libertarians"" think that just because they have the right to refuse the vaccine, it gives them the right to trespass on others and violate the measures those others have for their safety?

EDIT:   If your comment is just some variation of ""What about protected class x"" I just ask you check if someone else has stated exactly the situation you are talking about already, and think about joining that discussion.

I'm trying to keep up and respond to people, but I can only do so much.    If you looked over the other comments saying that and think you legitimately have a new angle on it, please comment, but if there's already a discussion going about the same comment, maybe hold back.",1638466002.0,"Not a fan of all those ""we only serve the vaccinated"" and ""we only serve the unvaccinated"" as response, but you're right. Individual property owner can obviously deny access to anyone for any reason.","Libertarians should always believe in NAP, body autonomy, and individual freedom... simple as that.","You're right but it works both ways. The government shouldn't be forcing companies to require them either. It's their property, not the governments, right?","Yup this is how it should work, business making the decision for themselves.",Again? Wasn’t this just posted yesterday?,"Staying on point with the trespassing aspect by those who don’t like the rules. I agree with your sentiment. Everyone else who feels the need to show up these businesses on account of their perceived liberties is an Aristocratic Neanderthal, in my humble opinion.",I may not agree with it but that is their choice as private citizens and property owners. Just as they can deny their access to naked people so can they to the unvaccinated.,The right to medical privacy means that the business has no right to request medical records of people to determine vaccination status.,"I'm not seeing this at all from the ""anti-vaxxers"". In fact, I don't see a single business in my area (or state even) saying only vaccinated people can come onto their property.","The only issue I have with gov-supported vaccines is that the gov can box out competition by the unvaxxed in certain sectors, such as healthcare. Right now, due to gov intervention, the unvaxxed health care workers cannot simply organize and open pop-up practices, for example. 

However, a private company can make those choices, cakes, vaccines, or otherwise, and we can speak with our dollars and live in alignment with values which means being conscious consumers and working only for organizations that match our values, whatever they may be.",im not getting the vaccine and you're 100% right. if sally who owns the drugstore down the street wants everyone that walks through her door to be vaccinated because she believes its effective and keeps her and everyone in her store safe then i shouldn't be allowed in,"You dont fight with a store that has a no shirt no shoes sign outside, same if it says firearms our prohibited on their property. You have the right to choose if you want the vaccine but therefore must respect businesses choice to how they want to run their business. Another example I have friends who refuse to eat at chick a fila because they're religious background and its the business choice to run that way and for the individual not to eat there",What about respecting other individuals who are put in danger by not being vaccinated?,"Which should include hospitals.

If you get real sick and aren't vaccinated by now, you can die on your own dime.  Don't go taking up valuable resources.",Yes but the government is mandating that businesses require it in some areas. As long as the business isn't being forced to require vaccinations then they can do whatever they want IMO.,We don’t live in a libertarian society.,"You shouldn't be forced to do something against your will, just to be able to live a normal life. There has to be a balance between self liberty and property rights of others or else we can get Jim crow type discrimination, but by the same token we need to respect others property and their right to ask for you to wear a mask or something of the like.","The issue isn’t companies enforcing vaccine mandates, the issue is govt is forcing companies to mandate vaccines. This post is useless and dumb.","Was just thinking about this yesterday.  I was going back and forth on whether a private business has the right to require & verify all patrons are vaccinated against COVID.  I lean more towards the individual freedoms over businesses.  One could argue, ""if the business requires it and you're not vaccinated, go elsewhere.""  But what if all businesses you need to visit require it?  The individual is pretty much forced out or forced into taking the vaccine in order to rejoin society.  As well, many people would & will use the excuse, well if businesses are going to require proof of vaccination, the government might as well require it too.

But then I think about the Christian baker, and how it would be unfair for them to be forced to bake a cake for a gay couple if it conflicts with their religious beliefs and how they have the right to refuse service, and draw parallels between that.  I guess I would say I am very hesitantly in agreement that a business *can* require proof of vaccination for their patrons since it's their business and they can deny service to whomever, but do not support that idea that they *should.*  As well, people have a right to privacy of health & medical conditions.","I agree with this completely. The last time I said something similar to someone they went off about ""If you really feel that way then you must also feel it's ok to deny customers based on their gender, sexuality or color...which means you also disagree with the civil rights act""

I mean that's jumping to a lot of conclusions but he wasn't wrong. If a private company wants to discriminate their customer base that's their choice. If the results of that means no one will patronize a bigoted/racist company and they end up closing down for that well then that's just darwinism in business. The government should have no say here.",Free choice is gone now. Get the jab or your a demon. That is what's happening.,I have all the reasons I need to deny my patronage to businesses run by invasive pigs.,Well I guess we should be okay if companies start expelling black people from their property too.,The thing is that the corporates wont do such things if they wasnt a government to enforce such stupid covid laws to exclude „unvaxxed“.,"I disagree with the notion that anyone should be able to ask about the medical status of anyone else.

If vaccines work, why should the vaccinated care about the status of others???",90% of those businesses are being forced or heavily incentivized by the government to only allow vaccinated,"I mostly agree with you, my caveat is how “necessary” the store is.   If a nonvaxxed person cannot buy groceries then that’s an issue.  If a nonvaxxed person cannot go to a concert then that’s not an issue. 

Employment is a whole other bag of worms.  I’m not sure how I feel on that one yet.","Because it's asinine, as the ""vaccine"" doesn't really protect you against anything.",ok OP lemme pose a question: do you say the same when/if a grocery store wants to deny entry to unvaccinated individuals?,"This logic applies to all protected classes, including things like barring a certain skin color from your restaurant. I'm for getting rid of all protected classes and letting the free market end racism as it has for thousands of years.",i think that's fair but isn't it technically discrimination,"Id say as long as the state is mandating the stores require something then it's probably fine to ignore the stores requirements from a moral/libertarian point of view.

Its actually anti-fascism at that point.

Its one reason why the state is so awful. Its every action poisons humans perceptions of each other. And makes peoples motives suspect.","We've strayed far from that long before the pandemic. You cannot deny (or only allow) people into your business based  on sexual orientation, religion, etc.","Oh really. Let's extend that concept to people of certain races or creeds.

Not such a great idea.","How do you check though?  And can I also request your STD test, the number of abortions you have had, your weight, health risks etc etc.  I mean a store probably has a vested interest in not allowing over weight people in with balance issues.  Hell, the law currently forces them to set up special entry for handicapped people.

So you can't currently do any of those things, why should vaccine be different?","I agree with you..  and there is nothing libratarian about govenors dictating we have to wear masks indoors, or threatening to fine establishments for allowing people to not wear masks.","Honest question, where do they gain the right to inquire any of my health status?

Private businesses dont ask if you get your flu shot this year so why allow this to be a thing? It can only be supported and upheld by a government. 

What stops them from denying based on any arbitrary criteria? Do we draw the line at age, race, health, hair color, or height? There are any number of arbitrary things that could be decided.","This whole ""anti-vaxxer"" argument has become so one sided it's insane. Most of the so called ""anti-vaxxers"" including myself are absolutely for vaccines. Just not at gunpoint, and especially this one with a less than 2% mortality rate and an even less chance of catching it. (I did have covid)

Now that I got that off my chest.  I get your argument for private property rights. In a black and white world it makes sense. But the world is gray. For example That arguement goes out the window the second they told businesses ""no smoking"".  (I don't smoke BTW). If the non smokers don't wanna go to a restaurant because they allow smoking that's the business's risk of loss. And by that logic I could open a restaurant and say unvaccinated only.  How fast would the local government be down there if I did that? 

Realistically speaking we don't have property rights.  Don't pay property tax you lose your property. Break some bullshit local ordinance as a business you lose your business. 

So if I can open a business with the inverse rule of unvaccinated only I'd be in agreement. But that won't be allowed to happen.",So you think you should be able to have access to everyone’s medical records for them to do business with you?  Good luck with that.,So glad I live in Florida...,I haven’t seen many people complaining about this tbh. it’s the government mandate that is the problem,Have you tried not living in fear?,">So why do so many ""Libertarians"" think that just because they have the right to refuse the vaccine, it gives them the right to trespass on others and violate the measures those others have for their safety?

""Because HIPPA,"" obviously",[removed],"It absolutely should be the right of a business to not only require their employees to be vaccinated (costs about 5 bucks) so as not to incur absenteeism or even losing an employee to the disease (and a hospital stay is gonna cost the business a heap of money), but also to reduce the risk to their employees from unvaccinated customers, and vice versa. 

All it’s going to take is one successful lawsuit against a business for spreading Covid (and for damages suffered) because they were negligent in not containing the virus and damn near everyone will start checking vaccination cards at the door.

That lawsuit could come from an employee, an employer, a contractor, their health insurance carrier, someone else’s health insurance carrier, you name it. 

There is a whole lot of as-yet untapped tort potential here that could destroy entire businesses.",It’s kind of funny that this is the line that gets polite society left libertarians to be okay with discrimination.,What if the sign says “Whites Only”?,"This is awesome. I cant wait to deny certain genders, religions, and people who have made medical decisions I don't like entrance to my public store!",How would they know lol?,">But every anti-vaxxers I have spoken to insist on going into the properties of others. The store, the bank, the gas station, the movies, Etc.

In here?  Somehow I doubt that.  The other thread was created to acknowledge the anti-libertarian sentiment on this topic that is frequently propagated within r/libertarian threads.   You're just sitting here making a general argument about anti-vaxxers as a whole and saying it's not libertarian.  What's the point of this except to conflate one libertarian view (no government mandates) with an anti-libertarian view (no private business rights)?    
  

Is that what you're trying to do here?","Fair enough but, what right does the property owner have to request personal medical information?","Not allowing unvaccinated into public space is analogous to not allowing smoking in public space, but the risk is imminent with covid.  This necessary to protect the public from a virus that is mutating because it has been allowed to spread because of free-dumbs.",They have no right to ask the question. Try again.,"I would argue that non-governmental shunning of those who are knowingly and willingly increasing the risk of harm to others (at no real benefit to themselves either) is just about the most socially just way possible to deal with this kind of problem.

I've been trying to get my IRA's moved to ComputerShare for weeks. I've talked to Computershare many times and we have everything confirmed as doable.

**ComputerShare is directing customers to request a ""DTC W/T Transmission"" of their IRA Shares.** Simple as that. This process will send them to ComputerShare where they'll arrive in a separately identified account. There's no hurdles or bullshit.\**Enter Fidelity\**. If you ask them to do this, or any other Direct Registration of an IRA they will tell you that *can't*. **THEY HAVE NO REASON WHY.**

I've asked multiple agents this specific question:  
""Is there anything preventing you from DRSing my IRA account besides your boss's order?"" A: **NOPE.**

The usual response I get is it might be a taxable event. Fuck you Fidelity that's not your business. $6000 of that money is MY MONEY it's been taxed and I'm free to do with as I please. \*\*[^(https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qd228b/you\_can\_computer\_share\_your\_iras\_without\_getting/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qd228b/you_can_computer_share_your_iras_without_getting/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

# More specifically, Fidelity agents are saying THEY WOULD GET IN TROUBLE if they Registered your IRA.

They won't even make the attempt. I practically begged one agent. I asked if the system was in front of them and they said yes. I told them the transfer agent said to follow these specific instructions. The agent said they couldn't. Worse, they said they especially couldn't since they already checked with the back office and it wouldn't be possible to make it seem like an accident. I straight up told the agent I didn't want him to get in trouble but it's bullshit and they should just push the order through and see what happens. They wouldn't do it, which I understand. It's such a bullshit position for the agent to be in.

The Agents find it odd too. They'll tell you they're not allowed and they don't know why.

Upgrading stations to be accessible presents significant challenges. For example:

* Elevators are custom-engineered and specially-fabricated machines that need to fit perfectly into the space where they'll operate.
* Many stations need at least two or three elevators to get people from street level to a platform.
* Many platforms need widening before a station can be considered accessible, but open, adjacent space to do so may not be available. This is because even with an elevator, platforms need to safely accommodate wheelchairs and allow for safe passage, including around stairwells and elevator towers.
* For subway stations, adding one or more elevators can require relocating over a century of old utility lines and tunnels underground before we can begin excavating shafts and installing equipment. Determining where to add elevators from street level can also be a challenge due to where buildings are and how the surface-level streets and sidewalks are configured in relation to the spaces that exist underground.",It’s not just the disabled.  Every parent with a stroller or person with a large suitcase or elderly person with a grocery cart has been impacted by this.,"It’s appropriate the hero image is the Sheridan stop.

I know they’re working on it, but so many of the north-of-Wrigley stops are not just disabled-unfriendly, they’re kinda everyone-unfriendly. Lots of narrow stairwells that tend to accumulate moisture, which if you’ve got your hands full of packages, or I dunno, maybe a bit drunk: not the safest.","This is part of what certain people were bitching about in regards to the infrastructure bill. “Liberal wishlists” and “blue city bailouts” they called it. But in reality, the money allocated in this package will go a long way to actually improve this country. CTA expanding accessibility for people with disabilities is a perfect example.","is the o'hare-bound platform of the western blue line accessible? i know the forest park side is

i ask cause i can't think of where they would put elevators for damen and california but if they figured it out for western maybe they can",I feel bad for the people trying to carry their groceries up the stairs at Sheridan. Those stairs are treacherous.,"One of the worst experiences with accessibility for my dad was on the blue line coming from ohare.

I was baffled when we landed to discover there were no ramps on the train. You had to let the CTA worker at the booth know and they would unlock and bring out the ramp. I asked who would bring it out once when got to our stop, she asked us our stop and said an employee there would bring it out.

We get to our stop, I step off the train and wait there looking around so I could signal the employee that we were at this door. Nope, the doors closed behind me with my disabled father on the train. Ran downstairs to the booth where the employee was on her phone and told her what had happened.

Was able to meet up with my dad at the next stop.","Lucky, the Belmont Snack burned down. That's the perfect place for a station with elevator into the Belmont blue line station. Now they can dig up the southwest corner of Belmont/Kimball to make the morning commute even more annoying!",Still will take Chicago 8-10 years to accomplish this. Very slow construction,[deleted],Why not just gut the entire blue line. Start over completely? Build affordable housing right into the train cars themselves? Because no one seems to care that trains are sleeping cars for the homeless. It's a hidden shame. Poses a danger and limits seating. Why not have train conductors at CTA to eliminate loitering and enforce standards.,Anyone know if a small business can get some of that funding to make their brick and mortar shop disabled accesible?,They tore up the bridge where the Montrose Blue Line stop was for almost a year.

[Harry Potter] Could the Room of Requirement have created an alternative access to the Chamber of Secrets?,221,r78h67,AskScienceFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/r78h67/harry_potter_could_the_room_of_requirement_have/,34,"Initially I thought this was an easy “no”, but after re-reading the Deathly Hallows, two things struck out that make me think differently.


1.) A good impression, from Ron, speaking parseltongue was all that was needed to be able to open the door so he and Hermonie could grab a basilisk fang. This tells me that it doesn’t have to be Tom Riddle, Voldemort or a horcrux attached to Harry to access the chamber. 

2.) The Room of Requirement opened a tunnel that lead from the school all the way to Aberforth’s bar in Hogsmeade.  So the room’s limitations aren’t confined to the room itself.  


So now I’m wondering; if I really wanted a room that could give me direct access to the Chamber, would it have created one for me?",1638454784.0,"I would say yes.

The chamber is really just a large stone cavern/room.  It has a magical door yes, but the basilisk didn't use that door when it prowled in the castle so there are other entrances.

And as you mentioned, the room of requirement made that passage to Hogsmeade, so I can't see how the chamber would be any different.","I think the Room of Requirement could make a passage into the Chamber of Secrets however the process would be tricky.

From what I understand, the RoR requires a clear visual or concept that operates within the laws of magic. Everything else requires out-of-the-box thinking.

For example, Neville was able to build the passage to Hogsmead as a way to bypass the ""No Food"" limitation. It probably helped that there are a number of secret passages leading to the village that the Room of Requirement could take advantage of.  
\-

So, regarding the Chamber of Secrets you are faced with the following challenges:  
**1) Do you have a clear visual of what the Chamber of Secrets is?** 

Salazaar Slytherin might have had a number of secret rooms in the castle outside of his passion project. The RoR might inexplicably lead you to a room full of his private sock collection if you give it a vague concept of what you are seeking.

**2) Do you know where it is located?** 

As I suggested earlier, Neville was probably able to tap into the preexisting secret passages to Hogsmeade, a place which he has visited a number of times.  The Chamber of Secrets, however, is obviously not a well-known location. 

Technically, Ron HAS been outside the Chamber before but has not been inside (or at least not that I'm aware of). At best he would be able to make a passageway connecting to the entryway, probably by piggybacking onto the existing passage in the girl's bathroom.  


In a way the Room of Requirement operates rather similar to the Mirror of Erised. To get the full benefit of the magic you need to be very exact in how you utilize it. Your typical curious student hoping to find the Chamber of Secrets would not be able to summon a direct portal but would instead find a room with books discussing the history of Hogwarts. However those who have been inside the Chamber of Secrets before might have more success if they are very careful with their wish.","As far as we know the only limitation laid on the room as that it can’t create food, pretty much meaning that anything else is fair game be it a passage to the chamber of secrets of a functional Iron Man armour workshop.","No. I’m sure Salazar magically fortified the Chamber of Secrets to ensure just one point of entry accessible only to his “true heir.”

An additional thought: I assumed one of the other Hogwarts founders created the Room of Requirement, so to have it supersede whatever magical barriers surround the Chamber they also would need to know of its existence, which they didn’t. I’m thinking in the same way that you’d need a specialized lock pick to break a highly secure vault.","Do we know if the room of requirement was there before the castle ? like a natural magic formation/spirit ? Like maybe it's like the Dark Island in the Dresden Files, where on it's place it's very powerful, sentient..","A lot of people speculate that information is one of the exceptions to Gamp's law of elemental transfiguration (there are five of those, which are things you can't create with magic). Just like the Room cannot create food, one of the exceptions, it wouldn't be able to discern where the Chamber of Secrets is using magic.

This means the Room can't provide an entrance to the Chamber unless you already know where it is. There's limited utility to this (e.g., you know about the entrance but can't speak or mimic Parselmouth). I suppose it's also theoretically possible whoever made the Room knew where the Chamber was, so no need to conjure up the information, but that seems unlikely.",Huh does that mean they could have gone into Gringotts vaults using the Room?,"It would depend on the nature of the magic.  The Room of Requirement can do a lot, but it can't create food, for instance.

Perhaps, it COULD create the entrance, only for the door to be guarded by Parseltongue or something.","Huh, I always had a vague idea in my head that the secret passage itself must have already existed, just not been found, and the Room just hooked up to it, but no, the wiki seems to confirm that the Room created it. That definitely implies a remarkable degree of control over the castle's geometry outside the Room proper. 

It also lines up interestingly with the room's behavior regarding repeating rooms, i.e., it tries not to, hence the Room of Hidden Things being a single place. *But* it also does seem to know what will and will not work beyond just putting people in places that theoretically contain the resource they want; it sent them to Aberforth, not to, say, the Three Broomsticks, even though there was a preexisting secret passage it could have linked up to there. Because it knew Aberforth would actually feed the kids, even though they didn't know that was what they were asking for.   

This suggests to me that the Room of Requirement will indeed give you a passage to the Chamber of Secrets, *even if you don't specifically know the Chamber of Secrets exists*, if you ask for something that that's the right answer to - ""give me a place only I can access,"" say, or ""give me the ancient secrets of the founders"" - but only does this if you can actually access it, since otherwise it wouldn't be the right answer. Ron's level of ""speaking"" Parseltongue is clearly enough but someone who can't at all wouldn't be, I'd guess.","> A good impression, from Ron, speaking parseltongue was all that was needed to be able to open the door so he and Hermonie could grab a basilisk fang

This didn't happen in the book. In the book it was Harry. They obviously just changed it in the movie to save time","Yes, it's magic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Stock up on healthy, easy-to-eat snacks and meals (veggie sticks, apples, sandwich wraps, etc) so you have convenient food ready to go.

3. Get some cold brew coffee going, if that's your jam - if you get it brewing now, it'll be perfect by the time the servers are coming back online. ^^

4. Take a lot of walks/do some yoga/go for a run/hit the gym/get outside for some fresh air if you can. Lord knows it ain't happening tomorrow, so be good to your bod today.

1. Walk around periodically

2. Drink lots of water

Bonus points if they have to pick a point along that streach for STR and the rest flow in order (with wrapping around the first one.  Though I would let them choose direction.",Does this method normally generate decent stats? I did a test and got some pretty aweful stats.,"Do this, but then have the players take turns rolling 3d6. If the number they get is on the table, they get that number. Do this until all numbers are gone.","I never actually played dnd because A poor B 1 Charisma

Whee!,Example!,This is actually scary I like it,Okay that idea is fucking cool,"So are you guys allowed to use any number in the row you pick for any stat or do you have to keep them in order?

Tbh keeping them in order would be a fun way to handle stats for a one shot.","We did this for our one shot. Still had no idea how it works.  
  
But now my mute half orc monk has two 17's on her stats.","With 4d6 drop 1 I think this would be fun. 3d6 straight could be pretty disappointing (like a straight 6 4d6 drop 1)

Just tried it and my grid of 36 only got one 16, nothing else above 14. Best arrays being 16, 13, 13, 10, 10, 9 (Total of 71) or 16, 14, 11, 10, 8, 7 if you really need a strong 2nd stat. Highest stat total was 74 from 14, 13, 13, 12, 11, 11. 

Only 4/14 Even hit 70+, and 3 didn't even hit 60, Lowest being a total of 52, as 13, 10, 9, 8, 6, 6. 

Obviously they'd be choosing between the top few, but seems quite risky. Probably just as well off with standard 5e rolling.",Unironically my favorite method,Actually might use this one,just to make it crazier the DM does it behind the DM screen and players can choose whichever dice they want. It is now battleship dice.,"I use this but my players get to roll the grid. Also, the grid is used for the whole game. If you die and I consider the death because of being stupid, infighting, etc the line is lost and the next character chooses from the remaining lines. If the death was heroic, interesting, not your fault, etc then the line is returned and can be reused.","We had this once, but with 1d20. It felt insane, but the result was still pretty OP and DM decided to have permanent damage critical hits.",I think this is called stat array matrix or something like that,"I made an Excel Spreadsheet with macros to automatically roll those kind of arrays and also conditional formatting to highlight good and bad stats as well as show the total modifiers and full stat totals.

Unless this is like...in order, top to bottom ability scores? Then I guess people gotta get more strategic.","The favorite method I've ever heard about (unfortunately I haven't had a chance to really try it yet) was ""everyone rolls 4d6 and drops lowest, everyone can pick up whichever result they want from those rolled"". As is in the post it does take away the disparity of rolled scores to a major extent while keeping the fun of rolling, and in this case the bit of disparity it keeps helps it provide the player the choice on what type of character they want to make. Some players might prefer overall higher scores, some might want things more spread out, and some (like me) might want a combination of real highs and real lows.","So can they use numbers that were already chosen? Because if not, the first player is going to immediately decide whether everyone chooses rows or columns, not to mention if they choose the diagonal which knocks out literally everything","wait, I can use matrixes and algebra for making my character?

"A year later, Cyberpunk 2077 has fewer bugs but still feels like it's in Early Access",1375,r6we8k,cyberpunkgame,https://www.pcgamer.com/a-year-later-cyberpunk-2077-has-fewer-bugs-but-still-feels-like-its-in-early-access/,360,,1638412246.0,"**""...honestly, if you've waited this long, I recommend waiting another year to see if more than just bugs get patched. A lot—but not nearly everything—has been fixed in a year, but making Cyberpunk 2077 whole will mean not just fixing what's broken but addressing what's lacking.""**

This piece is so spot-on it hurts, and yet looking at this sub lately you'd figure 2077 was some fucking undiscovered gem.

Plenty of articles have captured parts of the feelings I had on the launch days, but this one has it all. From the life paths, to the montage, to the lack of a character arc and any character customization. And the bottom line fact that it isn't all just *bugs* that make up the issues with this game. Definitely bookmarking this one right next to Crowbcat's video and a few others.","You can fix 10000 more bugs and the game will still feel like early access. Why? Because it's the core game systems that are just bad, not actual bugs.

* Driving is just bad and has been from the start.
* Armor/DPS/Crafting/Perks are all unbalanced and broken, making the game super easy even on the hardest difficulties.
* Some perks just don't work or serve no purpose.
* AI is still dogshit, and would need a complete revamping from the ground up.
* Wanted levels/police are all poorly designed and don't really work. There's not even police chases.
* You never see your character, and when you do they look like a clown because stats are tied to clothing.

I could go on with the list but that's all I have patience for right now. I'm not even really going into all the shit that was promised that still isn't there. Overall the game is just lacking in practically every respect. Bug fixes won't fix that.","I can't believe how many games (and other important software) from the last almost 2 years are released unfinished.

Maybe working from home have some massive impact or it could be just mentality exhaustion of living in a uncertain times, but I hope once it goes away publishers to still care and fix those games.",Can we stop talking about the bugs and start talking about the things that matter? Like all the missing content and broken mechanics,"Finally an article where the writer isn't completely high on copium lol. 

3 ""major"" patches that really didn't fix 95% of the core issues.","Just when I'm ready to get back in, they push me back out.","Careful, you'll ruin the ""mostly positive"" circle-jerk.",I don't think anything can change the fact that it isn't the game we were promised,"'but making Cyberpunk 2077 whole will mean not just fixing what's broken but addressing what's lacking.'

This is what so many people can't wrap their heads around. All they talk about is bugs, 'the bugs are gone so the game's good now...right???'

Nope, if there isn't some of these improvements added before the expansion (because we should NOT be paying for these) it's basically over for this game.",all it takes is adding free time activities so the world wouldn't feel like just decorations,"Cant wait to read the comments from people, like: ""but I liked it, its my GOTY 10/10, even though I know all the flaws"" or the famous one from a person who hasnt been on the internet before ""I just finished the game and had a blast, I dunno why this game gets shit on"".","Yeah but apparently if you’ve never heard any of the marketing before, live in a complete bubble and just “so randomly” got this game on a whim utilizing a heavy sale discount with absolutely zero expectations — well then it’s amazing!!! looks so great!! Wow!!

Unfortunately if you didn’t live in a bubble and had the audacity to trust the developers to keep essentially any of their promises the experience was a little less enjoyable. In the end it feels like a half made demo of a futuristic GTA made by inexperienced developers who could make the game look amazing but couldn’t figure out how to make it enjoyable to play. Like it’s meant to demonstrate the visual tech, not be an actual game. 

I still never finished the last mission because it crashed, kept crashing on boot up (I’m on PC but this was months ago) and then I honestly just moved the fuck on and started other games out of sheer frustration. I am but a mere mortal; my time in this realm is limited and I only have so much patience to reinstall the same fucking game over and over again in hopes it works to play the FINAL MISSION of all things. Since then I have had absolutely no desire to return to be honest. Everything just feels so fucking hallow. Not worth the frustration.

I dunno what the hell is going on with the gaming industry but it feels like nothing but unfinished garbage has been released the past few years by major developers.","I’ve got my fingers crossed that the next gen update at least lays the foundation for the missing elements of the game we’ve been wanting since launch. Really want them to flesh out rpg elements, add third person, and improve the UI all around. I can only hope though…","Got this game for $10 recently. Would like to get a refund…. 

I was initially excited to see what this game offered, but after two hours of so much dialogue, and so many times I would bump into someone and then the whole world is having a shootout with me. Load back in and it’s the same shootout scenario. 

When I aimed in to shoot back, all I could see was a zoomed in version of the inside of my characters teeth and a gun. 

It’s been like a year, and the game is still not functional. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.",Thats the lie they tried to sell. And this is surprising how?,"Honestly, I played on release on PC and regarding (game breaking) bugs, I barely encountered any and still could enjoy the game somewhat.. but it wasn't anything that I expected and I ended up being severely dissapointed with the overall gameplay and story. -- I started ''rushing'' through the missions, because there was no real reward for exploring as there was nothing to interact with. I just wanted to see where the story was going, but even that ended up being somewhat a dissapointment.

Story, characters and lore/fleshing it out was severely dissapointing and all over the place. Characters made no sense with their behavior, moral standing and attitude as they were all conflicting.

Lack of actual content and interaction is what killed it for me, no replay value.","People really can’t help themselves when it comes to loving CDPR. The moment all the anger soiled down for a while, you suddenly see this “Mostly Positive” circlejerk take control of this sub, with all these newcomers attempting to change the narrative around this game, when it is still a problematic game.

SMH.,I played it again a few weeks ago and encoutered more bugs than at launch 😭,"Really? Early access? I'll admit the game could have been more. I haven't even completed it. I loved the scale of the city and the detail. But come on, early access is a pretty dumb way to describe this game.",Shocked Pikachu face,"I pre-purchased this. I haven't played the game, I'm gonna wait another year to see if they deliver, else I'm gonna use that sweet refund policy Gog has.","So I got Cyberpunk on release on Stadia because my PC wasn't quite powerful enough and I didn't have a PS5 at the time. My experience on Stadia was fantastic, nearly 200 hours, maybe 1 or 2 crashes (and that may have been Stadia rather than Cyberpunk) nearly no bugs, game ran in performance mode at 1080p with targeted 60fps, it was genuinely very playable and very good. My only issue was the actual controls on Stadia, I had significant controller lag over WiFi (fixable if you play through chrome and plug in your controller). The load times on Stadia were also literally instantaneous.

I recently picked the game up on PS5 for cheap so that I'd have the next gen upgrade when it came out, I've got just under 7 hours in it and I've had 5 crashes. Minimal bugs, but I've seen a few more than I recall on Stadia. Controls feel 10x better, visuals are sharper, runs at a locked 60fps. Load times are quite a bit longer than Stadia which surprised me.

If anybody wants to experience Cyberpunk and doesn't have a high end PC, buy it on Stadia and play through Chrome using your Playstation/Xbox controller, no need to buy the Chromecast and controller. In my opinion, for most people, this is still the best way to experience the game. It's disappointing that the Stadia version wasn't talked about more as an option for those on last gen. The game is fantastic.","at this point i could live with the bugs, i'm more disappointed with feeling that there was a lot of cut content. i also remember finishing my first play through and thinking man, i really enjoyed the story, lets see how a different life path affects it...man was i disappointed to see the only differences were short-lived intro scenes and alternative dialogue choices.","Guys, the game will never have the things that was promised to us, just get used to it. That would be another game. If we are lucky, we get some ""proper"" DLCs, that's it.

What's in it is mostly good, but it's not what was promised, it's a half-finished game now, and it always will be one.",Have you played 2042. Masterpiece in comparison. Still things I would like to see done and arguablyneeds to be done. But slow way down woth the early access comparison.,The first DLC should be about the different lifepaths. No debate. + the basic content we don't have,Not going to lie I thoroughly enjoyed that game  ... Even when I ran it on my 2060 ko ultra... I I went through 5 different endings and It was a blast... Now I have a 3080ti and I just go back in and load different saves with ray tracing on and F about in awe! Love that game and the soundtrack is Dope AF,"I feel it’s time to for CDPR to cut their losses & move on to Cyberpunk 2078.

And once they do that, the modders can finally take over & finish what they started. Cause it’s clear they’re happy with the game & moving the 300+ devs onto the next game.

It’s an unpopular opinion but it’s for the best. Modders clearly love this hand & CDPR don’t :/","I just enjoy it as it is. If CDPR makes it better someday with updates, then fine, I’ll just play it again. Good for me",Shut up ffs,"Going to wait until that PS5 version and then see if I have to wait for another year or not.

Hell. I might even wait for DLC and then see.","I got my money's worth out of it, but... I started a new game the other day after not having played it for maybe 6 months, and I couldn't stop thinking that all the lore and the world they built was so cool but so underutilized",Still waiting for my NG+....,"It’s a solid Far Cry clone, and that’s it. Any more expectations are unfulfilled and would require significant redesign of the game, and that’s probably not gonna happen.",All of this. The writer nailed exactly how I’ve felt the last year about this game.,I feel like the fact that they misled the gaming community into believing the game would include certain features is definitely something that should be addressed,I purchased 2077 on launch (Xbox One X and now Series X) and have yet to actually install it after everything I’ve read. I’m going to continue to wait but honestly I may never get around to playing it now. It’s just very disappointing.,"Major bugs I've experienced were mod-connected. Games not perfect, far from it, but definitely worth the $18 I paid for it.","They need to think about how well received the first mission was vs the rest of the main story.  Unfortunately someone else said it I don't think there is much they can do at this point to fix what's wrong with the game. It's not just bugs, they really failed at the main story, like they had all the pieces there but it just didn't work together. Best we can hope for is a second game that doesn't feel so soulless. For Christ's sake they made Keanu's story far more engaging than anything our character was doing. I would have rather just played an on the rails story about Johnny","Who fuxking cares about bugs?? I don't, I love flying through the air on a motorcycle after running full speed ahead into a light pole. Plus it looks epic, haven't seen any other game based in a futuristic era (space doesn't count) ever pretty much. It's such an aesthetic. With techwear and warcore being a style I love wearing since 2020, cyberpunk has given me many ideas for outfits. <3","Hell yeah, what an embarrassment this game is","If it is early access on pc, on ps4 it is develloper beta test.

Just sayin'","With fewer bugs it's showing how barebones the story is, which isn't a bad thing but CDPR has to make any expansion expand upon the story that's there. The only other option is to do a complete story overhaul getting all the voice actors back to record new lines. Though if they did do a story overhaul I think that the whole first half of the game should be your character trying to get revenge on Dexter Deshawn for betraying you and because they already have it in there the option to have Delamain take you to ""de doll de whore"" and leave Dexter out of it, and the Delamain takes you to Pacifica to meet her.",Literally the only thing I’ve had issues with are rendering speeds. Takes about 15-30 secs for the textures And AI characters to actually move but it’s still playable.

Planning a website that’s only explored via accessibility tools,7,r472b2,Blind,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/r472b2/planning_a_website_thats_only_explored_via/,16,"Im a web developer and I want to get better at creating accessible websites. 

My idea is to create a a small website that is completely black and only controllable by keyboard and screen readers providing examples for other developers to learn. 

I am not blind nor do I personally know a person with vision impairment, so I would like to know your feedback and ideas:

-	What do you think of the idea in general?
-	what topics / content would you like to read on the page

I also welcome anyone who wants to contribute content or ideas!",1638114110.0,"Its pretty easy to make a website that is completely accessible to people who are blind or vision impaired. don't use CSS or JavaScript. Be sure to use semantic HTML the way it was indented to be used. Be sure to include an appropriate amount of heading tags.

  &nbsp;

doing this you should be able to easily navigate the site with only a keyboard so that covers all disabled people that can't use a mouse.

  &nbsp;

now learn to use the popular screen reader NVDA to properly explore the page. its a free screen reader and most blind people use it. its a little tricky to get the hang up but if you spend a day trying to figure it out you should be able to. even if you are good at using it, it can be difficult to recognize where there issues if you are sighted because you can cheat without even realizing it. but if you do these things you should be able to make a site that is most likely accessible to everyone.

  &nbsp;

doing this is actually extremely easy but the final product isn't going to look great. the real challenge is to make a website that looks really good to sighted users AND has a lot of useful JavaScript functions. Even this isn't all that difficult but the majority of websites miss the mark by at least a little.","Accessibility is more than just people with blindness. Accessibility can be anyone with a disability. 

There are people with low vision impairments such as cataracts, near and far sightedness, etc.

There are people with motor function disabilities, where they navigate use tap screens or keyboards and mouth sticks.

Even people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia.

(There are more to consider as well. This is not an exhaustive list)

In order to truly learn how to make an accessible website you need to consider a holistic approach to it. You have to apply multiple techniques to achieve a good understanding and compliance of your website for Accessibility.

WCAG, WebAIM are all good resources to start with.",Fill it with Easter eggs! Make it so using each accessibility feature reveals another Easter egg.,"Do not do this at all. The whole point of accessible design is to be inclusive, and creating a ""blind experience"" site only serves to segregate  the overall learning process. Designers and engineers need to learn how to use screen readers first, not just get dumped straight into an experience where they would need to use assistive tech suddenly; their lack of training and experience will create a lot of negative effects on the process, usually pressuring them to solve for things they don't understand. Try designing With us, not For us. 

Ultimately, if you are creating any website, just use native HTML 5 controls and follow the WCAG best practices. If you absolutely must have a custom control, if it can't be done with HTML or Aria, then it isn't worth building. There are already lots of sites out there that teach the best practices and ask the important questions of design and engineering when it comes to putting accessible websites together, plus good training from places like DeQue University. It's not only the blind experience you need to solve for, but visually impaired, mobility impaired, cognitively impaired, hearing and speech impaired, and people with epilepsy. That's all encompassed with inclusive design, and making an experience that you are thinking of breaks that entirely.","I'm making a subreddit for gift ideas for blind people...though it just got finished yesterday so i don't have any people on it, but if you need a blind beta tester I'd be happy to do so","if someone made a website that was only explorable by reading text out of images and with graphical links all over the place, we'd not be happy. This seems a similar level of stupid to me.","I worry it's just going to make the other web devs think that you can't make a good looking, fully functional, modern site screen reader accessible unless you strip it down to something from the early 90s.  And that's not at all true.

The best thing to do in my experience is to simply have people actually use a screen reader them selves after teaching them the basics, with a good blindfold on.  Have them try an existing site that's bad, one that's good, and best yet, something they made them selves.

Empathy seems to do allot with this kind of thing.

Besides, alternative versions of a website just for screen readers tend not to be a great idea either because they never end up getting updated at the same rate as the main site, and for certain sectors that can be a big problem. So starting off with the idea that it should be a custom thing VS thinking about it with every update of the main site and using good coding practices is kind of counterintuitive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reminder that the Early Access and Standard codes for Endwalker are different! You will need to enter another code on December 7th.,39,r78wzf,ffxiv,https://support.na.square-enix.com/faqarticle.php?id=5382&la=1&kid=78779&ret=main,37,,1638456091.0,"**CLARIFICATION: This is only for PC players!  PS4/PS5 players do not need to do this.  There is a grace period betwenen December 7th and 10th for players to enter their keys and still play while they wait.**

Reminded my static to make sure they had their early access keys entered this morning and discovered some confusion about the difference between the early access key and the standard key for Endwalker.

When pre-ordering Endwalker, you are provided with two game keys--1 key for pre-purchase bonuses (including Menphina's earring and Early Access) and 1 key for the actual expansion. [These keys are separate and the standard key will need to be entered on December 7th](https://i.gyazo.com/35122050c4b8728bc7214e4c711d89c0.png).  There is a grace period between December 7th and 10th where you can still play Endwalker if you registered for early access but have not registered the full expansion yet.  This is to provide extra time for players to receive their second key via email.

Purchasing Endwalker past December 7th will provide only a single key for the version of the expansion you bought.

Steps on how to check your keys for all versions of the game:

* If you bought through Steam, you can right-click the game in your library, open the ""Manage"" menu, and then click ""CD Keys"" to view all your keys.  Both keys are currently available, but you cannot enter the full expansion key until December 7th.

* If you bought the Standalone launcher version, you will receive an email from your retailer/square enix with the second key on December 7th.  If you bought directly from the Square Enix store, your key will also be available in your Square Enix account.  If you did not buy through the Square Enix store, then your second key may be also available online depending on your retailer on December 7th.

* If you bought the PS4/PS5 versions, then the copy of the game is tied to your PlayStation account and you do not need to enter a second key.","Why is this game so complicated to buy? I have it, I got all my keys ready and everything. It just seems like the hardest part of this game is actually getting it for the platform, edition, early access or standard. Sheesshhh!","Does that mean no Collector's Edition items until December 7? I assume those are included in full expansion, since I only have Pre Order and Collector's Edition Content codes on Steam.",I bought it directly from the Square Enix store. The second key will show up even on my profile right? Just like the first key right?,Reminder that you don’t have to do any of this bullshit on PlayStation,"Question: I see the Early Access Code, but where is the actual activation one? Is that being sent or am I just not seeing it?","Have they let us know yer when we can actually enter our EW code?

Long since already did the Early Access one, but when can I enter the full code? (Steam User, code ready and waiting to use it.)",They literally sent an email reminding us about it.,"This is the collectors edition key, right?","I wonder if Humble is sending out the full access code later then? I've checked my email they sent me when I pre-ordered and my keys on their store, and I just have the one code for the Pre-Order/Early Access D:",mine was already auto activated on my profile and only used the pre order code.,i assume if you pre ordered it without a square enix store account they just send a link with the full access code on the 7th,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Get rid of your parking place because I want an easier access to mine!,28,r7axn1,EntitledPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/r7axn1/get_rid_of_your_parking_place_because_i_want_an/,1,"So this story happened about 2 months ago and I still can’t believe how entitled my neighbour can be sometimes. I live in a small building with 6 appartements in an old street filled with old town houses. My next door neighbour sold a part of her land next to her house to build this tiny building so it’s the only one in the street. Because of that, it has a bit of an odd configuration with the garages : it’s a car elevator with a double door system. You open the first door to enter with your car then directly a second door to enter my neighbour’s garage or you can go down to enter the underground parking of the building.

This lift is not always working properly and we had several issues with it but most of them seemed to have been fixed. The other day, I was talking about that with my next door neighbour because we had another problem in the garage and then she goes:

Neighbour : “This lift is useless, it’s never working, whe should get rid of it.”

Me, a bit surprised : “You mean completely replace it by another one? Well it would be expensive, we should try to fix it first.”

Neighbour : “No I mean taking it off, no lift at all.”  
Me, confused : “What? But how we will get to the parking underneath without it?”

Neighbour : “Well we won’t, that’s not a big deal and it would be soooo much easier for me to get to my garage.”  
Me : “..... You do realise that there are 5 underground parking places belonging to our neighbours right? Do you really think they will agree to “get rid” of the lift and make their parking places completely useless?”

Neighbour : “Well...they don’t use all the parkings places. Some of them are left empty.”

Me : “Yeah but that’s their problem, it doesn’t mean they will never rent or sell it to someone someday.” 

Neighbour : “They can’t rent or sell a parking place if the lift is not working perfectly!”

Me : “Well it’s at least easier then to try to sell a parking place without any car access to it!

You really think the others will agree to have a parking who takes half of the building’s basement completely useless because you want easier access to your garage?

Besides, even if you buy all the parking places to the other owners (she frowned at that idea, she didn’t even consider it) and magically manage to have the agreement of the rest of the building’s owners to get rid of the car elevator, you still would have to ask the permission to the city hall. I don’t see how they will agree to completely change half of the building and make the basement completely useless, just for your convenience.

She looked at me like a toddler who heard “No you can’t have that”. She never considered the fact that maybe the other owners wouldn’t be really pleased to get rid of their parking places just for her and for free.",1638461795.0,How would getting rid of the lift make her garage easier to access?

YSK: SciHub is a free recourse to get access to the majority of research papers,6174,r69hrq,YouShouldKnow,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/r69hrq/ysk_scihub_is_a_free_recourse_to_get_access_to/,144,"Why YSK: So many journal articles in science specifically are locked behind extreme paywalls, especially recently published papers with exciting information. I've seen paywalls that range from $50-$200 just to get access to one article. SciHub was founded by a Kazakhstan woman, Alexandra Elbakyan, to make scientific information more accessible to the general public. As a STEM major, I look through tons of research papers every week and a friend of mine recently told me about this, so I wanted to share incredible resource for anyone who is unaware, especially people in the scientific community.

Edit: So glad to see everyone sharing additional resources & information about the inner workings of publishing research in general. I had no idea that it was such a monopolized industry & scientists actually have to pay if they want people to read their research. Thanks to everyone & please continue sharing this vital info! - signed a future scientist.",1638344917.0,"To people not familiar with this system: go ahead and bypass the paywall because authors don't make a cent either way. The more accessible our papers, the more citations we get anyway. 

Signed: a completely fed up scientist.","Sci hub is fantastic! I use it all the time. No more looking at abstracts and wondering what the full paper said. Almost always get what I look for.

Connected papers is also great. Plug the doi in there and it will give you a whole bunch of references to similar studies that don't necessarily come up on Google scholar.","People who read this might also be interested in Unpaywall. They have a a handy browser extension that immediately lets you access papers for free if a free version exists somewhere. A link with a green lock will appear on most scientific sources, like PubMed if the extension knows where you can access the paper for free. [https://unpaywall.org/](https://unpaywall.org/)","YSK: If you email the authors and ask them for a copy of the paper, they will almost always send it to you free of charge. 

Source: I'm a published HIV-1 researcher and basically everyone I've ever worked with think the ""pay-per-view"" system of disseminating scientific information is fucking dumb.",Sometimes you need a vpn to access scihub,"Authors pay to get published, often to the tune of $1500-2000 for a single paper. Much more for big shot journals.
Readers have to pay to read these papers.
Scientists themselves are also reviewers for peer's papers. They are not paid for reviewing. 

Basically scientists pay to publish and read without making a single cent.",My university Library agrees: paywalls are awful and only benefit publishers. Go ahead and climb over it.,"FYI if you are interested in physics, maths or comsci papers then you may have better luck with [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Basically everyone in those fields uploads a version of their paper onto Arxiv as soon as its accepted!",Been using that website for awhile. it has helped me access soo many papers.,"To add: Also on iOS depending on how the paper is published there is a Aa in the top left corner, press that and try “reader view” as it sometimes bypasses the bullshit and displays the text on the website. Doesn’t work for PDF stuff, just native web publishings/articles.","Also LibGen for books/articles
(Just Google it because the domain keeps changing)","Seriously most STEM professors mention scihub during syllabus week. ""Remember, while sci-hub and lig-gen have free copies of our textbook and any articles you might need piracy is wrong and you shouldn't do it ;)""","DO NOT HUG IT TO DEATH! ..please

I rely on this.

Bonus YSKs: Searching on Sci Hub via the article DOI is usually more effective than with just the title. You can find this, most of the time, on the page listing the paywall article originally or through Google Scholar (which is another fantastic resource). Also, do not download the extension if prompted. Use of Sci Hub does NOT require any sort of extension. Switch to another browser if this is an issue. Lastly, due to the nature of the website, it's URL changes fairly often. To find the most recent one, visit the Sci Hub wikipedia page. The current and active URLs are listed on the right.",Alternatively if you reach out to the author they are usually quite happy to provide a copy to you for free!,"About a decade ago I got three job offers at the same time. One was a tobacco company, the second was an oil exploration company and the third was a company that published scientific journals.

I did a bit of research and eventually decided to go with the oil company, because it was the least ethically compromised industry of the three.
The scientific publishing industry has some seriously scummy corners.

If you can get it for free, do. The people who do the research don't get any financial cut whatsoever. If you can't find it for free, contact the researchers direct and (unless a publisher has tied them into a scummy contract) they'll usually send it to you for free. 

(I left the oil company for somewhere better after a few months)",[deleted],"Booksc.org

Used to work real well too. Helped a professor get access to a research paper she wrote but couldnt find it for free until i tracked it down.

Edited for clarity","you should also know that it's illegal and it's piracy, don't use it in school computers or school vpn's because they can be means for termination. Use with caution.",Nice.  These were considered illegal between 2017 and 2020.  /s,"There’s also a SciHub Telegram bot that is super useful in countries where the main site is blocked, so you don’t have to hunt for proxies or other working domains. And it works exactly the same. Send the bot a message with the DOI and if it has the article, you get it on the spot.",NCBI (from the NIH) is also free,"You can also write an e-mail to the study's first author.

More often than not, you'll get an excited scientist happily sharing their paper and maybe even some anecdotes.",Access to the site has been banned in Austria.,"If you are a university affiliate, please use your library. Even if they do not have access to it, they will purchase a copy for you through a service called InterLibrary Loan which depending on what it is will arrive with 24 hours digitally. Further, if you are publishing, please consider publishing open access",How does scihub do this? Do they buy the article from the journal and upload it in their servers?,"Just to advise also do not widely advertise you are using scihub. It's fantastic, but it's also piracy and can get you in trouble.","Where's my ""I could have used this while I was still in school"" crew?",You also have zlibrary which doesn't only provide u with articles but whole books as well! One of those things that you just love the internet for.,"FAQ: Q - is this legal?

A - maybe? No?

Q - Fuck it journals are scams?

A - fuck it. Journals are scams.

Fyi i use scihub to access journals that i legally have the right to view due to my institute but cant access due to poor paywall implemenation.

Fuck it. Journals are scams","This is also piracy. Just an FYI. Not that it would stop many of you, but just something to keep in mind.",I’m just worried it’ll get shut down if too many people find out about it lol. So I try not to share it too much. Although I might be wrong.,blame ghislaine's dad,An other YSK : SciHub is blocked by some ISPs (I think it's all of them in France). You need to use a VPN in that case,Reach out to the authors. The vast majority would be more than happy to send you a copy for free.,My school blocked scihub on the wifi smh,"As a young scientist whose university refuses to pay for anything other than cell, nature, science …. I have almost never gone to pubmed in my whole PhD. I came to scihub and never looked back. You might have to wait a week or two for the paper after pub but yea fuck elsevier just fuck them to hell lol","Scihub is useful, and imo open access publishing should be standard (at the very least for any research supported at all by public money). Just be aware SciHub gathers (potentially through phishing) institutional logins, which likely explains why many institutions try to block it. 

https://www.science.org/content/article/whos-downloading-pirated-papers-everyone",Scihub is fun because it's a game of which mirror is going to be working today.,Resource,"I love this!  Now we just need a way to access legislation for free.  The mind boggles doesn't it?

You have to abide by the laws (legislation) but they charge you to access the information.  And the subscription is extortionate!",Is there an easily accessible site with all this information? It’d be nice if there was a quick synopsis of a bill and then who voted for/against.

No access to airbnb - host refusing full refund,38,r745el,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/r745el/no_access_to_airbnb_host_refusing_full_refund/,53,"Hi,

I booked an airbnb weeks ago for a weekend in Scotland. The night we travelled, the U.K. was hit by Storm Arwen - documented as the worst storm in 15 years. The warnings for the area we went to were upgraded quickly and we were caught off guard. 90mph winds, tons of trees and power lines were brought down. Access to our host’s rural property was blocked by fallen trees so we couldn’t get there, and couldn’t contact them due to a power cut and fallen phone lines in the area for several days. As a result, for 2 nights we had to pay for another place to stay while we waited for roads to clear. We couldn’t contact the host to cancel either for above reasons.

Unfortunately the host is refusing a full refund despite the fact she knows we couldn’t get there. Under the Airbnb extenuating circumstances policy it would be covered under an ‘extreme weather event’ - there was also no access to the property and it was not habitable due to the power cut. I have raised it with support and they keep blackballing me and saying this situation isn’t covered - but they won’t explain why. I’ve only got a 50% refund and think I should get the full amount.

I get it’s annoying for the host to be out of pocket, but this is such a rare weather event in the U.K. I really feel they should refund me in good faith. Any suggestions?",1638439373.0,"You go through AirBnb here.

The host might have a different view of what happened and if access was possible. Customer support should be able to determine if your situation fits within the policy. If they are not responding to you, message them on Twitter, that usually moves things along. There are likely other guests in the exact same situation as you.","You need to quote the actual policy to them.  Most of the AB&B support are sub-contractors that get no training and do not know the policies.  Forwarding to a ""higher level"" is a joke too.  It's bad for us hosts too.

You may need to do a chargeback on your credit card.",I would refund if I had been hosting you. I don’t understand why so many negative responses.,"This is a tough one. Technically you didn’t complain within the first 24 hours of the stay which constitutes an acceptance of the property and a successful checkin. When it comes to access, the host is not responsible for the roads, traffic or any other impediments that don’t fall on their property directly. You may not have had access to the road leading up to the host’s property but that is a municipal issue. With that being said, if the power to the property was still out by the 3rd day, a refund should be issued as this directly impacts your stay. This is assuming however that you checked in and they didn’t have a generator to keep power flowing.",">We couldn’t contact the host to cancel...

You don't contact the host, you contact Airbnb.","Check the cancellation policy and always have travel insurance. Airbnb does not cover tropical weather where I live (hurricanes) and I have strict cancellation policy, I recommend insurance to my guests as soon as they book.",So in an event which was NO one's fault you are complaining that you are not getting a 100% refund and the host takes the total loss. Am I reading this correctly?,"Travel insurance should cover weather related issues, your host is not a travel insurance company.  If you did not purchase insurance than your trip is not insured.","If you had booked your stay at a hotel, and you were unable to cancel or contact them before arrival, you could not ask the hotel for a refund. 

So I’m not sure why you’re expecting the same from airbnb and the host?","Host must be in a similar situation. If she issues the full refund, she'll have a big financial loss on those days that were booked but not occupied for circumstances out of her control.

I think the 50% resolution was the way to go.","A weather event happened, no one's fault. You're upset the host isn't taking 100% of the loss instead of 50/50 ? a half refund seems very reasonable to me.",As always depends on the cancellation policy of the host. Contact your travel insurance provider as they should cover anything that you have lost in regards to accommodation.,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patch Notes: Early Access - v0.5.1.5 - Build 174799,5,r7g24p,SatisfactoryGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/r7g24p/patch_notes_early_access_v0515_build_174799/,3,"**Hi Pioneers!**

Hello again everybody, just a few small FICS\*MAS related fixes and a UI change to the Network Quality setting in the options menu.

Regarding the Network Quality setting, a while back we increased the default settings for it, so if you are having issues connecting in Multiplayer, switching it back to Medium (Default), Or Increasing it to a higher value might solve those issues, so we suggest trying out the settings to see if it helps.

If we’re forgetting about some important issue please let us know over at our QA Site [https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/) We read your comments every day.

Merry FICS\*MAS!, Hope you’re all having a fun time with the update, see you all again soon <3

**BUG FIXES**

* Some minor FICS\*MAS related bug fixes

**UI**

* Added a pop up when switching the Network Quality setting explaining that it requires a restart to be effective
* Updated the tooltip of the Network Quality setting explaining what it does

**KNOWN ISSUES**

* A reminder for people who have been having issues with unexpected crashes on startup or weird behavior with the game, in that case please try to verify your game files.

You can do this on Steam by Right Clicking the game in your Library > Properties > Local Files > Verify integrity of game files...

And on Epic by clicking on the three dots (“...”) next to the title or at the right side, depending on your selected library view > Verify 

This may or may not redownload a large amount of files which might take a while depending on your internet connection or hard drive speeds so be wary of that.

If you are using mods, they might need to be updated or uninstalled after updating so please keep this in mind too.

* If you are experiencing issues launching the game or loading a save and you have already verified your files, you might have some incompatibility with DX12 as the default renderer, you can try the following launch options to try to force DX11, DX12 or Vulkan to run respectively.
   * d3d11
   * DX11
   * d3d12
   * DX12
   * vulkan
* Dedicated Server Crash reports, Currently Crashes that happen on a Dedicated Server are automatically sent to us, this is enabled by default, we plan on including a toggle for this in GUI but for the moment, if you want to disable automatically sending crash logs you can do this:
   * Go to the Server Install folder
   * Open “Engine.ini”
   * Add the following:

&#8203;

    [CrashReportClient]
    bImplicitSend=False

But ty for acting so fast in fixing the Network issues.","**GOOD UPDATE**

Hopefully the changes to Network Quality will help those using Multiplayer Mode.

Unsure, but I don't think the Network Quality Fixes / Changes applies to Dedicated Servers for Early Access Branch since they were not mentioned. There was however a Dedicated Server Update for Experimental / Beta Branch - see [Patch Notes: Early Access (EXPERIMENTAL) - v0.5.1.6 - Build 174824](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/r7g6mi/patch_notes_early_access_experimental_v0516_build/) also released today.

Changes for: November 13 -28, 2021

Bright Nights launcher/updater by [4nonch](https://github.com/4nonch/BN---Primitive-Launcher/releases): [https://github.com/4nonch/BN---Primitive-Launcher/releases](https://github.com/4nonch/BN---Primitive-Launcher/releases)

**NEW!** Bright Nights launcher/updater (also works for DDA!) by [qrrk](https://github.com/qrrk): [https://github.com/qrrk/Catapult/releases](https://github.com/qrrk/Catapult/releases)

We have iOS build now [https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmbn/comments/q3zj5i/cataclysm\_bright\_nights\_for\_ios\_is\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmbn/comments/q3zj5i/cataclysm_bright_nights_for_ios_is_here/) by  [u/Antique\_Skin3514](https://www.reddit.com/user/Antique_Skin3514/) !

[Coolthulhu](https://github.com/Coolthulhu) finished AoE cone of fire feature! Having guns only produce projectiles and explosions limits variety.  Cones for shotguns and maybe flamethrowers could make those weapons stand out and maybe even become useful. And now BN has that! For now only to birdshot, but it can be used for other things- all json firendly!

[olanti-p](https://github.com/olanti-p)  implemented steady consumers for electric grid. It implements active furniture that constantly consumes electric charge,  can be turned on and off, and can change into different furniture when  it runs out of power. All with Json support! Additionally he did important npc fixes.

[chaosvolt](https://github.com/chaosvolt)  Fleshed out plutonium usage and spawns. Now plutonium power are more more Lore friendly and logical! Also he fixed placement of some city buildings and improved foraging.

[SzQ1](https://github.com/SzQ1), [Theawesomeboophis](https://github.com/Theawesomeboophis) working with UndeadPeople tileset. But for most things it is work in progress- many things have to be clarified

And last, but not least - airports now has chance to contain helicopter parts and more chances to spawn helicopter itself.

* Tileset work. I'm occasionally adding new objects, like the new electric grid elements, and they could use new tiles.
* Balance    analysis. Those should be rather in depth or  ""obviously           correct"".  Obviously correct would be things      like: ""weapon   x         has  strictly      better  stats than y,  but  y requires     rarer components  and  has    otherwise  identical   requirements"".

Patch Notes: Early Access (EXPERIMENTAL) - v0.5.1.6 - Build 174824,7,r7g6mi,SatisfactoryGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/r7g6mi/patch_notes_early_access_experimental_v0516_build/,3,"**Hi Pioneers!**

Hello once again everybody, this is a new experimental patch for us to continue working on the Dedicated Servers, as always, if you are having issues with his patch consider moving to the Early Access (default) version instead.

If the patch is working better or we introduced some new issues specific to it, please let us know over at our QA Site [https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/) We read your comments every day.

Merry FICS\*MAS!, Hope you’re all having a fun time with the update, see you all again soon <3

**DEDICATED SERVERS**

* Improved stability of the packet router
* Improved CPU usage of the packet router
* Added a startup argument for disabling the packet router

&#8203;

    -DisablePacketRouting

**KNOWN ISSUES**

* Packet routing is incompatible with multihome, so we're automatically disabling the former when the latter is enabled
* A reminder for people who have been having issues with unexpected crashes on startup or weird behavior with the game, in that case please try to verify your game files.

You can do this on Steam by Right Clicking the game in your Library > Properties > Local Files > Verify integrity of game files...

And on Epic by clicking on the three dots (“...”) next to the title or at the right side, depending on your selected library view > Verify 

This may or may not redownload a large amount of files which might take a while depending on your internet connection or hard drive speeds so be wary of that.

If you are using mods, they might need to be updated or uninstalled after updating so please keep this in mind too.

* If you are experiencing issues launching the game or loading a save and you have already verified your files, you might have some incompatibility with DX12 as the default renderer, you can try the following launch options to try to force DX11, DX12 or Vulkan to run respectively.
   * d3d11
   * DX11
   * d3d12
   * DX12
   * vulkan
* Dedicated Server Crash reports, Currently Crashes that happen on a Dedicated Server are automatically sent to us, this is enabled by default, we plan on including a toggle for this in GUI but for the moment, if you want to disable automatically sending crash logs you can do this:
   * Go to the Server Install folder
   * Open “Engine.ini”
   * Add the following:

&#8203;

    [CrashReportClient]
    bImplicitSend=False

* Save changes and restart the Server
* To Disable Seasonal Events on Dedicated Server, you need to enter this command from the server console and then reload the game or restart the server: (Save and Load from the Save Manager also works)

&#8203;

    FG.DisableSeasonalEvents 1

Using the following launch option should also work:

    -DisableSeasonalEvents",1638476046.0,"**GOOD UPDATE**

This looks like a Dedicated Server Only Game Patch related to changes to Packet Routing.

So I’m using new resin atm and this happened twice now and always with this mold! I never had this problem before with my other resin or this mold! I don’t know why these bubbles are there! I’ve used a hot air gun to get rid of access bubbles and I have a heat mat under the resin to keep it warm!,24,r768mm,ResinCasting,https://i.redd.it/ljyvmom4g4381.jpg,10,,1638447514.0,I had this issue with a ash tray mold. I solved it by letting the resin sit a while once mixed before I poured and then once I poured I ran a tooth pick around the edges and up the sides to release anything that might of formed. Fixed my issued maybe try that,"I’ve been having this problem with some of my coasters… I think it’s because I’ve been pouring in too much resin at once instead of layer by layer. Maybe just do a quick base layer first and keep an eye on it, popping any bubbles that might form after 30 minutes or so. Once the base layer has set, go ahead with the rest but little by little. Also, as someone else mentioned, letting your resin sit for about 10 minutes before pouring can be helpful. I’ve been letting mine sit until I feel the side of my cup and it’s warm. I have had very few bubble issues since I started doing that",Warming definitely helps with mixing but you don't completely have to do it I don't ever warm mine. But I do let it sit for about 10 min after mixing to allow all bubbles to surface. Hit it with my heat then pour slowly. Tooth pick it. Then hit it with heat again and it usually comes out bubble free lol. Happy pouring.,"A broad few suggestions: 

-As others say, warm the resin. This also helps somewhat with mixing it.

-Mixing slowly helps introduce less bubbles. 

-Let it sit for a few minutes. This let's it degas a moment and have most bubbles raise to the top. Hit that with the heat gun. (Most mold makers recommend this too, to help prevent damage to the mold)

-when you pour, lightly massage the edges. I see some bubbles in spots I've had similar issues on similar molds (like the bottom left) Sometimes I have to gently take a toothpick and run it around the edges. Just be mindful not to damage the mold with your tool. 

-Change up your resin! Slow cure resin is made to introduce less bubbles. If it's a deeper mold, there are resins for that. If it's reasonable for you to do, experiment!

-If you want a good test to see if any of these are working, do a cast of a lighter clear color (or just clear,) so you might be able to see those bubbles while trying any fixes.

Good luck! Hope this helps.",He is still adorable! Just a little charred.....get it....?

Climbers don't even make up half the traffic to calico basin now that the scenic loop has a reservation system.

Honestly, I'm kind of on board with this as a new system. What's going on right now is unsustainable.

With that said, I wouldn't mind getting rid of the multi million dollar homes there and making them additional parking but we know that isn't going to happen....",Commented and shared!,Thank you and posted. This needs to be fought tooth and nail.,"Let's see...climbers and tourons show up and trash the place, the agency in charge wants to put an end to the abuse...Access Fund tries to make the agency look like the bad guys.

Salt Lake City is now charging Google Fiber for an Access fee,8,r7c8h1,SaltLakeCity,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/r7c8h1/salt_lake_city_is_now_charging_google_fiber_for/,3,"Below is the text from the notification from them:

>Starting February 1, 2022, a new Salt Lake City Access Fee will appear on your monthly bill. This fee will be in addition to the monthly charge for your internet plan. This fee is 2% of the monthly cost of your internet plan. 
While we do our best to include all fees in the flat, predictable price you pay for internet (like installation and hardware), our contract with Salt Lake City has changed, including how we compensate them for access to roads, infrastructure and public areas for construction, maintenance, and repairs. 
It's important to note that Google Fiber passes on 100% of this fee to Salt Lake City. 
We appreciate your business and want to thank you for being a valued Google Fiber customer",1638465385.0,"Which makes sense, considering Google is profiting off of public lands and infrastructure. 

Blame Google for passing on the cost to you, not SLC for rightfully being compensated.",FYI Google and Google Fiber are not the same.  Google Fiber itself does not make a profit off your monthly bill.  It takes Google Fiber roughly 2-3 years to break even on the install cost for each address they connect.  Alphabet and Google see their ROI by proxy through getting more people connected to the internet and clicking links and ads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[A3] [NA/EU] [Merge<] [Recruiting] Is that a BTR?

Featured on [*BI's SITREP #00231*](https://dev.arma3.com/post/sitrep-00231), we're happy to celebrate 7 years of [*incredible Arma memories*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ck_WtKbV1k&) with all our friends here, and you're welcome to join the fun! Currently, we **average around 30-50 players per session** and are always looking for people interested in a gaming group that values teamwork, integrity, improvement, good times, and great beer. We are most suited to **North American timezones** with our sessions running **Wednesday and Sunday at 7pm CT,** but we do allow anybody from around the world to play with us. We [*work as a team*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qApzmxrDGZI) to accomplish our missions and we're always sure to [*have a laugh along the way*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk6QwHpBLyk) , whether we succeed or [*explode gloriously*](https://youtu.be/Yj57opgT9m0).

**The TL/DR of our community?**

* 18+ Age Limit ^((17 Yr olds stay as recruit until 18))
* We're all about the fun of immersive Arma with none of the pushups and hierarchies of more serious milsim.
* We emphasize positive reinforcement for critique and encourage learning. Arma is chaotic by design and overcoming its challenge as a team with 50 of your friends is a feeling few games can match.
* Our playstyle is easy to learn if you've never done milsim, and there's nothing more immersive for us than teaching an enthusiastic/terrified newbie how to identify a BTR or BMD based on how hard your bunker is currently exploding.
* We want good, positive people that want to have fun; skills can always be learned! We pride ourselves on having a community full of awesome, talented people who all help make BW work, whether from designing missions, voting for changes, or just by playing and being the most enthusiastic AR in the squad - we're grateful for every player that enjoys our efforts to create a consistently great Arma experience.
* No attendance requirements: Real life takes priority. A lot of us have college, jobs, families; we get it, play and participate as you're able!
* A 30-45 minute orientation will teach and/or confirm you know a basic level of tactics and strategies and determine if your modset is working properly. Advanced optional lessons/qualifications for leadership and piloting are also available!
* Come for the friendly competition of two large-scale TvTs (PvP) and stay for the massive and immersive CoOp (PvE) inbetween! A full session is roughly 3 hours, with after-hours games to wind down (Tron Races, TTT, Zombies, and more!)
* We have a customized framework that makes mission-making easily accessible and allows for fresh, creative and unique gameplay every session.
* Our mod pack is easy to install, with in-depth installation instructions on our forum; tech support is available through our Discord or on Teamspeak if it occurs during session time - reach out and we'll assist as we're able!
* No rank structures: Everyone's got a vote, whether a recruit or a long-standing member, in how the group evolves.
* We play more than Arma! Boardgames, DnD, Stellaris; our members play tons of games! You name it, you can probably find someone to play it with you! Use Discord or our forums to find a group or schedule something!
* The APEX and Contact expansions are **required**, all other DLC is optional. (If you don't have APEX or Contact you'll have to sit out those missions)

## How to Apply?

Send us an application on our [**main website**](http://www.bourbonwarfare.com/) and we'll get back to you ASAP, and stop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sW8CT2m) or [Teamspeak](https://ts3.bourbonwarfare.com) for a friendly welcome and many helping hands to get you started.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which logo design do you prefer and why? Terminal Mastermind - A little logic game about accessing computer terminals through deduction and a little bit of luck,14,r77ulb,Unity2D,https://i.redd.it/wxj5u1fdv4381.png,15,,1638452931.0,"2 or 5.
Those have clear lock icon. I think this is where accent should be.
2 if lock is very important and 5 if it's more or less regular thing.","1, it overall keeps the same style and in my opinion is the best one",I like 3 & 5.,"It's hard to decide cause i can't really tell what the logo shape is about. If it's a box with a locked panel/screen on top I would prefer #4. I think the contrast between the white box and the black panel makes both stand out and that makes the logo more appealing to me. 

In #2 and #5 I think the whites make the focus confusing. In #2 there is too much focus on the lock and in #5 I don't know where to look.

In #3, I think that the perspective is a bit confusing. #1 Looks fine but maybe a bit too simple and not interesting enough.

If the logo is supposed to be a laptop or a computer then is a bit more confusing. I would give some details to the keyboard if that's the case or I would separate it from the screen a bit.

I'm not a logo designer so you shouldn't take what I said as granted but I hope my comment helped you somehow.",I like 2,I think it largely depends on what the rest of your assets look like. That being said I like #2,"I feel like logo needs to be flipped. I assume it’s supposed to be a terminal, but perspective is wrong.",1 bc simple and consistent.,"Judging only by these options I’d say #1 or #2, all others emphasize the box too much. Unless that’s what you want?

Overall I think the logo could be taken further.. the only element I recognize is the lock. The box doesn’t communicate anything to me and the perspective is somehow weird. What is it? Is it a computer terminal?

What are some BAD “accessible” products?,8,r7ahi1,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/r7ahi1/what_are_some_bad_accessible_products/,15,"Hi there! I am a disabled (cerebral palsy) college student studying Sociology. I am currently working on a paper in which I discuss technology in the sociological lens, with a special focus on disability accessibility.

One of the things I hope to discuss is a comparison between accessible products (such as liquid level sensors for vision impaired individuals) and bad “accessible” products.

What I’m looking for is ideas of products that are marketed to the disabled community, but do not deliver in one way or another. 

This is not an official survey, as I’m just looking for good starting points for products to research. All I need is the name of the product and why it doesn’t work. No names or private information will be discussed. Thank you!",1638460536.0,"My immediate first thought is a lot of the novelty gadget assistive tech that able-bodied college students invent that get them a ton of publicity and praise but aren't accessible at all. There was one that was supposed to be a ""white cane killer"" that was essentially a cane with a big, wide (like, 2 feet wide) heavy rolling tip that warns the user via text to speech about obstacles ahead, meanwhile actually navigating with it or using it like a cane is near impossible. It was just praise clickbait with zero real functional use. There was also this weird attitude throughout the article that the white cane is a primitive tool and that ""blind people deserve better"". Shit made me mad.

I can try to find the article about it if you would like, OP.",All the insanely expensive phones marketed at blind people that offer less functionality than a standard smartphone. Especially now standard smartphones have really good accessibility features now.,"Whenever I look at stuff like squeeze machines or silent clippers and the product is either described as being exclusively for young children, comes only in small child sizes, or one is charged an obscene amount more for the ""adult"" version.","Without knowing what bad truly means in this context -- price is obscene because a wheelchair part is proprietary AND can only be accessed by going through a manufacturer (no DIY repairs) 

Rideshare companies claiming to be disability friendly but only accommodating manual chair users only","Well, this isn't an ""accessible product"" at all, but I've found this useful for dealing/interacting with deaf co-workers: texts using my phone (or any cell phone that can make texts for that matter). I happen to work retail but have previous done note-taking for disabled students as a contracted job while I was a student in college.

Since I can't use ASL myself, this is the most accurate way I can say things as needed outside of gesturing. The irony is a lot of people, (including my mom), don't actually think to use their phones to do something like this without it being pointed out first. 

I find it somewhat disturbing and funny on just how many normal things can be easily used for basic disability accessibility with a bit of creativity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe it severely undercounts plays. I only have one song above 100 plays. However, these past few weeks I listened to a song quite a bit and it seemed accurate, so I have no idea. 

Also, I have allegedly listened to 208 artists and 134 albums? That’s just impossible. No, I don’t have playlists or albums that have “various artists” as their artist. 

The overall artists are correct I think, but the play counts are just too low. Most of my listens were online, too, so I have no idea honestly.",apple tryna be professional all the time and its really hurting the AM experience for me in comparison to spotify's more playful tones,"I love apple music, but Spotify's wrapped is way better then replay. Its one of those little things that eventually lead to people leaving AM for Spotify. Big picture who cares but certain little things Spotify does makes people switch","I just wish the head of Apple Music would look at the entire thing and ask themselves how can we make this better.  This service has been around for years yet it feels so stagnated.  Right now Spotify has a 3 month promotion which I'm tempted to do, but I can't get over the user interface and the difficulty of just incorporating your library and local files into an overall playlist.  That's something Apple is good at, but they really are sucking at everything else.  Why is it so hard to improve the service, and no making this Zane Lowe figure the spokesperson for Apple Music and introducing dolby atmos is not really what I have in mind.","Yeahhhh I been wishing for this for many years 
Only reason i considered switching Spotify tbh 

Considering how Apple does pretty much everything else right in other areas I would except something like that but it hasn’t happened","I've been using Last.fm to track my statistics, but it just isn't the same.","honestly, the only reason I stick with AM is due to the ability to organize local files. I've got hundreds of unreleased songs, mixtapes and projects not on streaming organized under the artist w/ art, tags etc.  I'd probably be with spotify if not for this.

Wish we had a Wrapped so bad. Replay is so bland.","incoming ""why would you even want that"" people 🙄",It's that time of year to wish we all had a Spotify wrapped instead of crappy website lol,I highly recommend last.fm which is still finicky but does count things a bit more accurately and gives you stats and stuff on a weekly basis (pretty fun if you like charts!),"Yeah, fomo is real and Apple is basically giving people to Spotify every year they don’t step up Replay",Agreed. It hurts Apple Music more than people would think.,"AM doesn't have wrapped but has a clutter-less app, high-quality audio options, and a consistent look on all devices. I used Spotify together with AM until 3 months ago when I just decided that it's garbage. They mix music, podcasts, all the time same recommendations, you can't find new artists, on every platform app/desktop/web works, and looks different. 

So, yeah, we don't have wrapped, but we have a very good music app. AM is not perfect but beats Spotify any time of the day.",This feature is what I really miss after moving from Spotify to Apple Music.,100% agree. It needs to be called Apple Music Peeled or something like that haha,AM has replay.music.apple.com which is also fun to share ☺️. It would be nice if all this stuff would be in the app. Fingers crossed. Maybe it will happen once.,This is the worst time of the year to be an Apple Music user,"Anyone that would consider switching to another app JUST because there's a marketing piece like Wrapped has got to re-evaluate why they are using that app in the first place, what makes it useful, because even though Apple Music and Spotify both stream music, they do it in different ways from a user experience perspective.",I wish people would stop complaining here and just switched already. Bye,"If you give me the choice between Spotify Wrapped once a year and have Lossless Audio, Hi-Res Audio all year long. I stay a thousand times with AM.

The only feature I really want to exist in AM is something like “Spotify Connect”.","Aww man. My Spotify stats were impacted because I took a free AM trial in October, but I haven’t listened to enough on AM to get a replay.",Every year at this time of year i wish the same thing. It's annoying,"Spotify is a better streaming platform, much better for discovering new music. Apple is better for offline local file merging with online music",terrible time of year for all of us 😔,"to be fair, apple music got dolby atmos and lossless support which spotify STILL hasn’t even implemented since it’s feb 2021 statement and we’re in december 2021. so yeah 🤷🏼‍♂️ 
but i admit, it is a really noice touch, spotify.",Are people still listening to music or are they just playing around with social gimmicks?,Apple not doing this just shows Spotify cares way more for their customers than Apple Music ffs. Spotify wrapped is way better than replay,I wish Apple Music had it,I think Spotify is getting as good as Apple Music. They not only have wrapped but recently lyrics,Is anyone else having trouble seeing their 2021 AM replay? It is telling me I haven’t listened to enough music which is just not true.,I dont know how I feel about wrapped this year. I listened to my daily mixes and thats about it so my top songs are all kind of random.,Everyone should just use last.fm and get statistics whenever you want instead of waiting till December every year,"I really do not get the appeal of Spotify Wrapped. At any point I can look at my listening activity in Apple Music, without having to use an external tool. I can view play counts, skip counts, last played, last skipped, and more. I can and do make my own smart playlists for this style (Wrapped) of curation. Customizable and available to me 24/7.

I'm looking forward to upgrading to Monterey so that I can use Shortcuts to enhance this experience even more.

But you know what I can't do? View *any* of my flipping data from Spotify. There's no way I can find how many times I listened to Easy on me in the month of October; no way I can see how my genres change throughout the seasons. I have to wait, and *hope* that Spotify's curators have the same goals of data analysis that I do...once a year. Sure, it's a pretty display of this information, but if what what we want so much is the insight of our music listening activity, a trendy PR campaign once a year is a terrible way to get that.",Just use last.fm. No need for flashy inaccurate pictures once a year.,"What’s super weird to me is that the Replay playlist DOES seem pretty accurate, while the replay web page seems rife with errors. The whole thing is just odd.",Agree completely,"If you care about this stuff, scrobble your listens to last.fm. Seeing analytics about your listening year round instead of yearly. And it's platform agnostic, so you don't just have to listen to stuff in AM to count.",Came here looking for a post about this,Report to Apple bug in their API. It not allows you to get your listening history. If it allowed people would create wrapped in a blink of an eye,ugh i agree. every single year i think “i’m gonna change to spotify” and then i never do.. but i really should. i have the worst FOMO with spotify wrapped every year.,I was far more impressed with my Deezer version of this. This years totally eclipsed Spotify which is one of Spotify's best features.,"I wish it wasn't such a slow buggy app on anything older than a iPhone 12. I also wish Apple would finally upgrade the sludgy iTunes media server farms they seem to still be using for TV+ and Music. I'm venting because I just deleted the app off my phone when I tried to go for a walk and the goddamn service kept hanging and stopping. I will revert to using PlexAmp for Hi-Res, and YT Music for regular streaming. Thank fuck it was a free trial, but I didn't even make it 3 months before I gave up.",Replay is also completely inaccurate for me,the one thing that is better is that replay is available year-round which is cool for watching your stats change over time. not that they give you a substantive amount of metrics though,"Seriously. We’ve been asking for years, how fucking hard is it Apple?",Meh. It’s the best feature Spotify has over Apple Music but that wouldn’t be enough to make me want to switch to Spotify. I still prefer having lossless and dolby as options for music listening,"For what it's worth, my Spotify Wrapped never matches my actual play stats. I've been heavily integrated with [last.fm](https://last.fm) since 2009 and scrobble everything I listen to. What Spotify offers as my top tracks for 2021 are NOT my top tracks for 2021. It's just music they want me to play, honestly.","You make a great point, just use Spotify 😂","It lowkey makes me so mad... it's a perfect streaming platform imo, why is this still an issue ? Why are they not actually making an effort it makes no sense at all.","I find Spotify users to be hyperbolic on how great Spotify is and how terrible AM is. 

I have an Apple Music subscription and also use Spotify. I use a service like FreeYourMusic or SongShift to transfer playlists from Spotify to AM and vice versa. Some weeks Spotify gives better recommendations and other weeks AM gives better ones. Neither is flawless and I’d argue if you think Spotify has flawless recommendations you have low standards. 

The service that has the best recommendations is still to this day Pandora.",Mine is super wrong this year. What a bust,I turned off listening history so that I wouldn't get recommended kids songs anymore...,"im really glad they actually glad AM doesn’t have this.

Spotify their wrapped would be fine if it wasn’t shareable on social media","Can someone tell me how to get my replay, because mine always said I haven’t listen to enough music but I’ve had it since 2017 and now I work overnight and I listen to my music from 11pm- 7am everyday I work.",AM did have a similar experience this year so maybe they’ll do something more closer to wrapped next year (that is available in the app and not just on the web),"I just wish they had a half decent search, this stuff can wait.","c'mon Apple, it costs basicly nothing to develop a feature like this, why are you stupid?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A couple subjects that I have seen people ask about the last few weeks:

>Loot Progression has been separated from Game Stage with its own Loot Stage system. Players will increase their loot stage similar to their game stage, but there are many bonuses that can add to it. The biome the player is in, the POI the player is looting, and even the container they are looking at can have a loot stage bonus. Loot stage will then boost the quality and/or the tier of items found. For example, adventurous players that explore the more difficult biomes and POI’s will find iron tools or advanced weapons a little faster than those that stay in the pine forest.

>Vehicles.  We have added mods, coloring and additional improvements and bug fixes to Vehicles. Mods improve different aspects of your vehicle like using less fuel. Any of the dyes you get during gameplay can be added to the cosmetic slot to tint the vehicle’s color.

>Vehicle Mods

I'm very curious about the grammar",this is pretty easy to pronounce,"Your ipa seems cool.

A few interesting choices though... like why have you done /kh/ -> [x] and similar? Cause if I'm interpreting that correctly as 'they think its /kh/ but actually they pronounce it [x] thats not really how IPA works, it should be /x/ too. If its sometimes [kh] and sometimes expressed as [x] then thats a more valid use of /kh/ if the phoneme in the language is /kh/ and just in certain situations or dialects it becomes [x] but remains the same phoneme(s).","Yeah. A lot of these are open syllables in the narrow transcription. Not a bad aesthetic either. The Velar-Palatal destinction reminds me of Irish

Also, berries being ""byum"" is adorable to me lol","Pronounceable to a theoretical person? Yes. To me? No, that's an awful lot of palatalisation. Irish needs to be stopped at all costs.","And I really really suck at IPA, at least with certain vowels and consonants. I have a hard time distinguishing between similar things, and I've been studying the IPA for months to come up with what I have so far.",Velarized s? I'm scared and need to go back to the Irish phonology wiki page.,"Swedish here, so the  Ä and Ö in your words is no problem. Overall fairly easy to figure out. The few words that took some guess work I just tested for what pronunciation sounded the most correct. 

I like the words and the structure overall of what I can read here, curious about your grammar and to see more words.","I like the Gaelic inspiration (that's the Gaelic sub-branch of the Celtic family; there's more than just Irish that has palatalisation and velarisation, people!). If you want to take some more inspiration, or want more ideas for some interesting phonological shenanigans, Irish has a system of onglides and offglides which are inserted between a vowel and a consonant of differing quality e.g. between a palatalised (""front"") consonant and a back vowel.

For onglides, for example, /nˠiː/ could come out as [nˠɰiː], where the velar approximant provides the transition from the ""back"" consonant to the front vowel. Also /tʲuː/ [tʲjuː] for the opposite combination. Irish also has that velar approximant become labio-velar after a labial consonant e.g. /bˠiː/ [bˠwiː]. You could extend this to the palatal approximant too if you so desired: /pʲoː/ [pʲɥoː].

Offglides work a little differently e.g. /iːlˠ/ [iːə̯lˠ], /oːlʲ/ [oːi̯lʲ], etc. You get the idea.

Have a read of the wiki page on Irish phonology, it has a section on these glides. Hope this helps somewhat.",Is that some kind of app that you’re making your dictionary on?

Half of America is now pretty unrestricted.

1. Do Nothing, Your goal was to just to end federal regulation.
2. In states you can, mostly red ones, try to end abortion as much as possible. Blue state abortions access is continue, if not expanded due to the backlash of this hypothetical
3. Use Texas like tactics to try to prevent state line crossing from abortion alongside #2.
4. Try to put in place a Federal Ban, an Anti Roe V Wade (though more likely though law than court ruling), This would be forcing states to ban abortion.

The First instinct is #4 but I've seen many people who are pro-life claim they are fine if it's left to the states. Is that True? Do you wish to see abortion banned further, or only where voters want it? Should states try to stop abortion seekers crossing state lines?  

I'm curious because this world is quickly approaching. It's likely Roe V Wade and following precedent is done, and the issue is returning to voters ultimately whether soon or not.

Halo Infinite is an accessibility,24,r3oa5j,halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/r3oa5j/halo_infinite_is_an_accessibility/,2,"This requires pretext: I'm legally blind, red-green colorblind, and my response to blue is very exaggerated. Despite this, I've always been able to develop a moderate amount of skill in Halo titles. In Halo 3, I landed in the 40s in the MLG playlist. Not great by any means, but I was capable of playing without any real issue.

343's insistence on removing team colors and relying on outlines is causing trouble for me because the outlines just don't appear very prominent to me. When I try to change them to more prominent colors, I then run into the issue that said prominent colors then contrast poorly with certain background elements - again, I'm red-green colorblind, so colors that obviously contrast to ""normal"" eyes don't necessarily contrast well for me.

Generally, I could fall back into a different simple tactic - use the red reticle to determine when I'm looking at an enemy. This, unfortunately, also fails to work because 343 disabled the red reticle from the PC version of the game.

Did 343 really throw basic accessibility under the bus just to attempt to push some microtransactions? As for no red reticle, is that really necessary? I can't think of any other PC games that have removed similar features to ""prevent cheating.""

I had high hopes for this game, but it just leaves me frustrated because of the poor accessibility.

The rates for children being born with Down syndrome have fallen dramatically since I was a child . It used to be common place to see a Down syndrome individual. 

They also had much higher rates of being given up for adoption in the old days and were hard to place into homes . 

We’ve never really discussed the COST to the state for the life long care of children given up to the state . I think if we had more honest discussion about money and the toll it can take on their caregivers ( your basically a caregiver for life ) we wouldn’t be where we are now . 

It’s easy to ban abortion for someone else when it doesn’t cost you anything ( or it’s not you who’s been raped ) . How many of the respondents answering these questions would have given up their own lives to care for a disabled child vs getting an abortion when they were in their 20’s ?

I had a client a few days ago that wanted a powershell script to conditional access rules (and a seperate small script to create groups which he would then use in the rules). I did the work without actually accepting the job (doing work through [freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com)) and never heard from him again. So I thought I would just put it up there for anyone to use.

I will actually start posting all of my jobs after they are done, with the employers consent, so if you are interested please check back every now and then.

I work Special Victims and focus exclusively on child abuse cases and pro-forced-birth rhetoric ABSOLUTELY leads to an increase in child abuse. Forcing a child to be born into an unsustainable situation where they cannot be supported leading them to be neglected, abused, injured, ignored, etc. when they are conscious of the neglect and abuse and 100% know what's going on but can't figure out why or how to stop it. We get moms telling kids all the time ""you should have been an abortion"" or too deeply addicted to drugs to care for them. We get women who were terminally ill while pregnant and died before being able to care for their children and their children ended up in a foster situation full of abuse. We have kids born perfectly normal and then abused into permanent brain and physical injury (we had 2 of these this year alone, one infant and one toddler). We have kids who are born into families where dad is complete lunatic and hits and abuses everyone. We have kids born with severe addiction problems, but it doesn't matter how much they suffer as long as they get born, right, pro-lifers?

Let me repeat: it doesn't matter how much they suffer as long as the kid gets born, right?

The plain truth of the matter is that restricted abortion access causes more suffering, poverty, abuse, and death. Study shows mothers denied abortion access more likely to need welfare, live below the poverty line, become unemployed, and be victims of DV along with their children:  [https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/new-study-sheds-light-on-what-happens-to-women-who-are-denied-abortions/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/new-study-sheds-light-on-what-happens-to-women-who-are-denied-abortions/)

Pro-""life"" people DO NOT CARE what happens to women or children, so long as the pregnancy is forced to continue. They do not care what situation the child is born into. They do not care that the foster and adoption system is totally broken and inadequate, they do not care that there is insufficient public money to support such families. They DO NOT CARE that family court doesn't always do its job. They are not in the slightest bit interested in what effect forced birth has on the mental and physical health of women or children. It means nothing to them since the science and stats DO NOT support them. The law does not support them. You may not tell women what to do with their bodies with any integrity.","Of course I am concerned about child abuse. However, the ""cure"" for child abuse which you are suggesting is one I can only view as equally bad or worse than the abuse. To imply that we have to support abortion because it ""cures"" child abuse is emotionally manipulative. There are many things that reduce child abuse. Safe Haven laws, parent education, poverty relieve, free contraceptives. I would rather find solutions that don't rely on killing the children during stages of development where they are viewed as less valuable.","The first study doesn’t have a control for socioeconomic conditions. https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/139/5/e20161616/38802/Community-Poverty-and-Child-Abuse-Fatalities-in?autologincheck=redirected

What’s interesting is that abortion restrictions cause an increase of contraception use which would reduce unwanted pregnancies. Birth rates actually remain pretty much the same. 

The second link is global data a problem with global data is that prolife laws do not work if contraception is not available. So you can’t compare the US and Haiti for instance like the data here does.","Why stop at socioeconomic status though?  Schopenhaur effectively (or consistently I think) argues that it is better that no one is born, because life is inevitable suffering.

I'm pro choice idk how to flair.","It’s always interesting to hear PC, who routinely advocates for the on-demand killing of the unborn, suddenly grow deeply concerned over whether the child might experience any form of maltreatment at some point in their life if they’re permitted to live. 🤔","Killing a child is killing a child. Hurting a child is hurting a child. Am I less upset that a newborn infant was killed than the fact that the newborn’s older sister survived abuse for years being killed? Do I feel a sense of relief that the infant therefore suffered less? No. So why would I feel any different when a child is killed inside the womb?

In terms of a woman preventing herself from maltreating her child, the selfless thing to do is to put the child up for adoption. If you really feel you are incapable of providing a safe home. Nonetheless we can’t make that decision for the parent and can only take parental rights away after the parent has obviously abused them in a manner that demonstrates they can’t provide a safe home to their children.","Yes it is a concern. I don’t like abuse, as do most pro choice and pro life people, and abusive parents should be put behind bars.

Is that right?",[removed],"Strictly speaking no. Since the consequences of an action don’t impact the morality of an action. You are also not responsible for the negative outcomes of good decisions.

""Result"" implies causation. The article discusses the correlation between mandatory waiting periods for legal abortions and restrictions on Medicaid funded abortions. It is hard to even make a causal hypothesis from these data. 

The answer to your title question, of course I am concerned with child abuse. Apply child abuse prevention strategies. Start with ""Don't shake the baby"" messaging in hospitals. Social workers. Even parenting classes in high school might help.","Yes, abuse, neglect and death are concerns and ways to combat maltreatment include promoting healthy connections between family and friends, creating support for basic needs such as food, shelter, transportation and clothing for parents, providing psychological and medical support to reduce stress of parents and educating parents on how to create a positive environment.","Any mistreatment of children is a concern, but what can you actually DO with that data?  Is there a suggestion that this is an argument for legalized abortion?  If so, then you are essentially saying that these children are better off dead than being mistreated.  Claiming benevolence via killing is very odd.  Also, what about all the aborted children that would NOT have been mistreated?  Are they just collateral damage and worth it to save those other children from mistreatment?  (By killing them)",Sure it is a concern. but the answer isn't to kill them.,"Obviously it's a concern, but I don't think the fact that you are going to suffer justifies killing you.

Or maybe OAG is the only thing that is public facing and the user won't be able access application at all until OAG as authenticated the user.

True that the user no longer needs a VPN to access the internal app, but making an internal application public accessible and relaying on authentication seems wrong to me. 

There are other solutions like Zscaler Private Access and Azure App Proxy that does something similar without making the application publicly accessible.

Thoughts?",1638475717.0,"I don't know Okta but I can speak on the principle on one of your thoughts. 

I think when it ""seems wrong"" about the application being accessible on the web without a VPN is probably because you're so used to doing it that way. If you think about it, a VPN is just relying on authentication and has a service open to the internet as well. This is as long as your application is encrypting traffic, probably with SSL. If the application is using HTTP or something like that, then a VPN is a better solution until they get with the times.","OAG is what I'd consider a ""true"" zero trust solution, as it implements a reverse proxy and does not provide network level access. Each connection is authenticated/authorized, rather than mapping IPs to users and allows access to applications at a L3/L4 level.

*That being said* \- We deployed OAG for about a month and ran into problems from day one. Lots of issues dealing with complex web applications (many homegrown). So if I had a website that was exposed into OAG, and it reached out to another internal server, then I need to create a new OAG app to allow access to the other internal server. This gets extremely complex when dealing with a split DNS zone, and you can't change the external DNS record to point towards OAG.

The more dangerous problem was OAG allows access to resources to everyone by default - without authentication. The project was immediately shut down because of the latter issue.

I would recommend looking at ZPA or Cloudflare for Teams instead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When connected to that network, accessing a specified IP address from a browser allows you to view the HMI content remotely. This device will travel around and will need to be able to display this info on any ""dumb"" TV screen **ideally** without a laptop/pc. Right now we are just accessing the IP address on a laptop and using an HDMI cord, but I'm hoping to find a device that can be plugged into the TV and access the network on its own. Here's what we've considered:

**Amazon Fire TV Stick**

We've tried this one. An apparent recent update to the OS extremely limits the Fire Stick capabilities when connected to a network without internet access--you can only access settings, etc. (no apps such as a browser). When looking at downgrading to a previous OS, it appears that Amazon has tripped an eFuse within the Fire Stick hardware that prevents such tampering.

**Google Chromecast**

Does not appear to have any built-in browser or a way to access a website. The only option would be to stream from a smartphone to the Chromecast which won't work for this application due to screen scaling and the need to maintain the appearance as seen on the HMI, and it still requires a separate device, the smartphone.

**Raspberry Pi**

I suggested that we could use a Raspberry Pi (maybe the Zero W (?)) to access the IP address. Could we program it such that when plugged in, it automatically connects to a specified network, navigates to the IP address, and displays it on the TV? Sorry if that's a dumb question, I have zero experience with any Raspberry Pi's so I don't know how simple that is.

The Fire Stick is what was recommended by the HMI supplier, but I don't think they were aware of the recent OS changes. I'm open to any other suggestions. Thank you!",1638462153.0,"from a cybersecurity perspective, i would absolutely not allow this kind of device to come anywhere near my DCS.

It's just a computer. It could be connected to the TV and used with a browser just like the laptop. Automatically starting the browser and navigating to an IP address would also be easy to set up.

```

  void emit(String message) {
    _controller.add(message);

Access to Satanic books in the school library?,38,r6ycix,SatanicTemple_Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatanicTemple_Reddit/comments/r6ycix/access_to_satanic_books_in_the_school_library/,12,"TLDR at the bottom.

Hey so for context, I attend a public high school that's not supposed to be including religion in the curriculum unless it's relevant and unbiased but in our library we have a section on religion. Today, our English class was in the library and I was looking through the religion section to see if there was anything on Satanism and if there was I was gonna check it out. Catalogs were down so I asked my teacher if she knew of anything and she gave me a look and said ""what do you think?""

I asked what she meant, to which she explained that we are in a ""primarily Christian society"" and that the subject matter is both controversial and makes people uncomfortable and so the school likely won't carry any books on or affiliated with Satanism. She said if I had an issue I should take it up with the librarian.

The school has such a wide array of books on religion which encompasses many different types of religions and obviously they can't include them all but my issue is more with my teachers reasoning for why they don't have it.

I'm thinking of going to my schools librarian and requesting that we include a book on Satanism (any recommendations?) and paganism since there weren't any either. I thought it might be worth a shot and I've really got nothing to lose. What do you all think if you don't mind?

I think your teacher is probably right- it’s not something many people would have requested and it will make people uncomfortable if they have it there.

So no your library isn't going to have anything about it. Your school isn't an asshole for not having it. It's your job to find and read about what you choose to. It's your beliefs. Not your school's or community.

Local Access Synology NAS via Chrome (unsecure),2,r7dwo5,synology,https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/r7dwo5/local_access_synology_nas_via_chrome_unsecure/,1,"Hi!

&#x200B;

Ive been reading a lot of stuff about keeping my NAS secure! I have open VPN installed and a certificate from letsEncrpyt, as well as firewalls etc.

I have managed to connect via [XXXX.synology.me](https://XXXX.synology.me) using port forwarding (which i then disabled, i just wanted to test the theory) and the HTTPS was there and secure, so the LE certificate clearly was correct for that part

What I cant seem to find a clear answer to ( and please point me in the right direction if ive missed it) is, that when i access my NAS via chrome, using the NAS ip (192.xxx.xx.xx:5001) within my LAN, i get a little broken padlock and the words ""Not Secure""

I know im within my LAN, and therefore only those logged into my router can see this,and they'd still have to access the DSM with login details. But, is it safe? No one can snoop on it? 

Ive been reading a lot and havent managed to:

1) find a real answser

2) Find a solution to the issue (if, that is, a solution needs to be found)

&#x200B;

Thanks everyone!",1638469930.0,That error just means that your computer can't verify the certificate authority for letsencrypt. When you connect to the quickconnect address it'll use a cert from Synology which is why that shows up good. When you go directly to it it'll present the cert from letsencrypt. You need to look into adding letsencrypt's CA cert to your trusted root store on the local computer.

A game jam for making blind accessible games started today! An interesting challenge for anyone wanting to learn how to make games more accessible.,549,r6cui6,gamedev,https://itch.io/jam/games-for-blind-gamers,49,,1638358751.0,Love the idea. I have a really cool idea for a blind accessible game that I’ve been wanting to build for years but it requires iPhone and AirPods for spacial audio. Looks like that won’t work for the jam. Are iPhones common in the visually impaired community?,"i thought about doing something like this ,  i think the ultimate goal would be playing your game and beating it with a blind fold on hah",Sounds interesting and It's something I think about a lot as a web developer but I didn't even consider it when making my own games. Only comment I have from the FAQ's is that graphics do matter as not everyone who is registered blind is 100% blind and so some will benefit from well designed graphics.,I made a blind game a few years back where you are a blind cat on a pirate ship. You use audio cues to try and find the guy with the food without falling overboard.,"Rather than just use sound cues, don't forget basically every modern controller has rumble; so you can use haptic feedback as well for your game.",great idea!,"Logo reminds me of lucasarts.

There are a few games specifically for the blind, where you use audio as the sensor and a wii balance board to interact with the world. 

I've learned though that most people who fall in the blind category do have some form of vision. So I hope they will specify if it must only target the 100% blind people. Otherwise, there are a great number of things you can do with the screen, like lighting it up fully with 1 color to indicate something, or split the screen into a few big segments with some light / dark variations to incorporate into the game. 

If the game must be playable by people who are 100% blind, those will not be usable, off course.",!RemindMe 29days 30 minutes,Sounds like something interesting.,Very cute. I'll try to participate,"This is such an interesting idea, I would love to explore the idea of audio and how that can tell a story vs. just visual. When we designed our game the audio was just as important in the story telling!",A recent 50 Years of Text Games post was about the FPS Shades of Doom (2005) and other games for blind people. https://if50.substack.com/p/2005-shades-of-doom. ([let's play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcdfn2OR25U)),"There was this really cool game a long time ago for iOS, I think it was a tie in with 5 Gum of all things and it started Benedict Cumberbatch.

It was set in the dark on a spaceship, you pressed left and right on the screen to step, played completely without sight required and you could fall over if you ran too fast.

The Nightjar was the name from some googling.
https://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/04/26/wrigleys-releases-audio-iphone-game-nightjar","I've always been interested in the idea of audio only narrative adventure games. Initially because I used to drive a lot but I bet it would do well with blind players.

Was thinking something along the lines of TellTale Walking Dead style with the narrator filling in the gaps between the dialogue of the fully voiced cast of characters, asking the player to make a decision with (hopefully) simple commands. Some could be time based if it's an action moment like a zombie coming for ya.","This is great to hear. I’ve been working with the members at audiogames.net for years. 

A great community over there and I owe a ton of my success to them. My rpg is pretty niche and without their support there is no way I’d still be making video games. 

For anyone who wants to try playing a game using voiceover it’s pretty challenging. While you can play my game without I’d assume a majority of my users are visually impaired.

For any tips with voiceover feel free to pm me.","You know that movie the Bone Collector where the ace detective is immobile, and makes phone calls to help other detectives solve who hurt him?

I always thought that would be amazing as a premise for an audio-only game.

You're directing a dumb detective.  Picture Patrick Warburton's characters...  And you can hear him describe what he sees, and what's happening around him.

How insulate end joist with very narrow access?,2,r7cx1k,HomeImprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/r7cx1k/how_insulate_end_joist_with_very_narrow_access/,3,"Pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/fxlh11D](https://imgur.com/a/fxlh11D)

In short - I have and end joist (joist **A**) that is set fairly far back from my foundation wall. As a result, the second to last joist (I'll call it joist **B**)on that side of my house very nearly touches the concrete. The joist (edge facing me) and concrete are nearly flush vertically, with a 1.5"" gap (from the sill)  


There are currently 3 areas where joist **B** is notched and provides extra access (plumbing to an addition, main electrical feed, previous electrical feed). I've had one contractor in to give a quote but brainstormed additional thoughts / options that I was hoping to get feedback on here before my other 2 insulation contractors give estimates

Option 1) They can hose in a bunch of treated cellulose via the existing notched areas. I hate this idea

Option 2) The can fill the 1.5"" gap with spray foam and then treat joist **B** as joist **A** and spray foam directly onto that

Option 3) I'm tempted to notch a few additional small aread in joist **B** just large enough to allow them to spray foam along joist **A.** This seems both radical and logical - in general it is dumb as f\*\*\* to weaken what is holding hour house up. On the other hand, this joist is already pretty damaged (notched 3 times!) and is exactly 1.5"" above the existing foundation. I feel like it's reasonable to basically consider it a a second base plate and  insert some 2x4 between joist **B** and the concrete on either side of where I would need to place access notches. I can't imagine it's going anywhere if it's literally sitting on the foundation

Any other thoughts would be very appreciated! Thanks!

Additional context: We've had a persistent mouse issue, so I ***very much want*** to be able to walk the permiter and visually verify it's fully sealed up in the future. The difference between being 99% sealed and 100% sealed is a huge boost to me- I'm tired of buying HEPA filters because a mouse shat in my golf clubs again. That's why all above options involve a sealed basement perimeter

Patch Notes: Early Access - v0.5.1.4 - Build 174686,106,r6nx1d,SatisfactoryGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/r6nx1d/patch_notes_early_access_v0514_build_174686/,19,"**Hi Pioneers!**

Here’s a small patch with some more bug fixes and some FICS\*MAS related fixes, hope they help!

If we introduced any new issues please let us know over at our QA Site [https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/) We read your comments every day.

PS: Early Access and Experimental have temporarily been brought back to parity again, but we will continue releasing Experimental patches to test new changes or features in the future that are too unstable for Early Access, so if you don’t want to worry about unexpected issues you should switch to the Early Access (default) version.

Merry FICS\*MAS!, Thanks for enjoying our game <3

**BUG FIXES**

* Fixed a bug where Trains docked at a Train Station could reserve Path Signals when Saving and Loading
* Fixed a case where Trains approaching Train Stations with a Path Signal right after the station would reserve the same Path Signal over and over
* Fixed holograms having the proper position for Client but the wrong one for Host/Server in some situations
* Fixed M.A.M. research tree “FICS\*MAS Holiday Event” not unlocking in some scenarios
* Fixed **game breaking** typo on the FICS\*MAS Calendar UI

**QUALITY OF LIFE**

* Added a launch option that Disables FICS\*MAS and any other Seasonal Events
   * \-DisableSeasonalEvents

(This does the same thing as ticking “Disable Seasonal Events” in the main menu or “FG.DisableSeasonalEvents 1” in console)

**KNOWN ISSUES**

* A reminder for people who have been having issues with unexpected crashes on startup or weird behavior with the game, in that case please try to verify your game files.

You can do this on Steam by Right Clicking the game in your Library > Properties > Local Files > Verify integrity of game files...

And on Epic by clicking on the three dots (“...”) next to the title or at the right side, depending on your selected library view > Verify

This may or may not redownload a large amount of files which might take a while depending on your internet connection or hard drive speeds so be wary of that.

If you are using mods, they might need to be updated or uninstalled after updating so please keep this in mind too.

* If you are experiencing issues launching the game or loading a save and you have already verified your files, you might have some incompatibility with DX12 as the default renderer, you can try the following launch options to try to force DX11, DX12 or Vulkan to run respectively.
   * d3d11
   * DX11
   * d3d12
   * DX12
   * vulkan
* Dedicated Server Crash reports, Currently Crashes that happen on a Dedicated Server are automatically sent to us, this is enabled by default, we plan on including a toggle for this in GUI but for the moment, if you want to disable automatically sending crash logs you can do this:
   * Go to the Server Install folder
   * Open “Engine.ini”
   * Add the following:

&#x200B;

    [CrashReportClient]
    bImplicitSend=False

* Save changes and restart the Server
* To Disable Seasonal Events on Dedicated Server, you need to enter this command from the server console and then reload the game or restart the server: (Save and Load from the Save Manager also works)

&#x200B;

    FG.DisableSeasonalEvents 1

* Using the following launch option should also work:

Is there a way to access the innerHTML of a Selection Object and edit it as a string?,2,r7cejh,learnjavascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/r7cejh/is_there_a_way_to_access_the_innerhtml_of_a/,0,"Been studying JavaScript for about 4 months off and on and as a learning project, I am trying to make a very basic text editor for user input and I am beginning with `<b></b>` tags.

Ideally, I would like to be able to treat the entire `innerHTML` content of a `contenteditable div` as a string that could be parsed with all `child nodes` being potential `substrings`. And have a `selection object` (itself being a `substring` containing editable `innerHTML`  ) that would convey its index within that `parent string`. And by comparing an `event` with the `parsed strings`, `tags` could be added/removed within them accordingly.   But I am unable to encounter a practical way to do that yet as `selection objects` and the `range objects` that come from them seem to have to do more with how they are related to existing `nodes` than `innerHTML` `strings` within those `nodes` (unless I am hopefully unaware of something).

Instead I am just now starting to deal with [selection objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) for first time, but after setting the first pair of `<b></b>` tags, the `Selection.anchorOffsets` don't seem to match( with what I would presume to expect ) with what is listed in the object as the `Selection.anchorNode`. And I am only able to find (so far) inner and outer `HTML` for the `parent element`, but not the `selection`. Plus the `offset` information in the `selection objects` only take into consideration the `inner text`. As of yet, I am only able to add the `tags`(next will work on undoing bold from a `selection`), but I do not like the way I am doing it as it adds too many `tags` for my liking.  Currently if I enlarge a bold section, I do so by adding another pair of `<b></b>` tags whereas I would prefer to delete and move the existing ones so that the enlarged area only contains 1 pair  instead of multiple pairs.

Does anyone have any advice on how to do this? My next attempts will probably involve creating more ranges within the `<div>` and trying to learn how to use them. This is my current code, using part of the Gettysburg Address as a placeholder text. [https://codepen.io/sethvan/pen/OJxVmrW](https://codepen.io/sethvan/pen/OJxVmrW)

Update: still getting out the kinks but looks like I have indeed used ranges to get it to leave only one pair of tags.

I’m not sure what I can say to help as I don’t know for myself either, but letting you know you’re not alone and not crazy for feeling this way x","Thank you for your submission.

* No selfies or human family pics, youtube channels, discord links, personal blogs. 
This also includes requests for research participants and any self-promotion/donation 
links    

* No memes or infographics link posts unless it's Friday

* No ""why did my bipolar SO/coworker/ex/parent/staff/boss do this?"" type posts. Short 
answer: No idea. Ask them or talk to a therapist about it. 

* Be kind to fellow users. No harassment or abusive language will be tolerated. Report 
and move on. Engaging just brings everyone down. 

* We are not Drs so please don't post asking us if you have BP. You wouldn't ask a 
cancer support group if you have cancer, so please don't ask us. 

* Please report self-harm and suicide threats. Users aren't equipped to intervene. 

Most of all be kind to yourself. We have a really great piece of the internet due to 
users like all of you sharing your struggles and offering support. We're here for each 
other in ways most people probably wont understand so use it often.

With all due respect to your effort in developing a project to this stage, my experience with similar games and the look of the game tell me that this is not worth my time. 

Quickly why I think this is the case:
- very bold naming convention implying that it's only a 'system', a basis for ""making your own game"" (almost every single project like this fails - it's like the programming joke about 14 competing standards)
- nothing in the UI suggests any unique functionality I wouldn't already know
- zero art direction, stock assets, probably free

Also, if everyone who has bought the game can play it before the 7th, doesn't that mean the release date is effectively the 3rd and not the 7th? What am I missing here??",1638477135.0,"Early Access is from the 3rd through the 7th. The 7th is the Official Launch. At that point, you can no longer pre-order the game.

The pre-order code (early access code) will still be valid and let you play until the 10th. That means you have until the 10th to enter the full game code to continue playing. This was especially used when they had physical copies to send out, to cover any minor delay in shipping (and if there was a major delay that they knew about, they could extend the early access code time). Now it overlaps just to give people a grace period to enter the full code.","Early access is valid until the 10th so that everyone has time to put in their actual expansion keys. It's a grace period, basically.",buffer window to input retail key,"It's for delays in receiving the actual game code, so you have 3 to still play in case there's any delay in receiving the real game code without it locking you out of the expansion.","> Also, if everyone who has bought the game can play it before the 7th, doesn't that mean the release date is effectively the 3rd and not the 7th?

Yes, you're right.

Only difference is that if for some weird reason you only have the EW code, without the EA, you can't do EW content until 7th.","The EA running three days past the street date is effectively a grace period for people to input their keys for the full game. As far as the release being ""effectively"" the 3rd, no. It is not. Until people who have ordered the digital CE start to receive their in-game goodies, the game is in early access.
